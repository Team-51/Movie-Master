Because in this series, excellent is the new normal and each individual segment a jewel.Aside from the aforementioned excellence at every possible level of production, the only odd thing I could spot here -- at the 40:00 minute mark -- was a close up of McShane that was tighter than anything in the series so far.Since the director does nothing by accident, I have to conclude it was intended but the purpose remains a mystery. Reminds me of British TV in the 50s, and that is all the explanation I can muster.Another odd thought -- sometimes the "western" dialog here, which is at such pains to be authentically western, sounds in terms of structure and syntax exactly like the dialog in Spartacus GOTA where the writers were at pains to be authentically Roman.No explanation for that either.', '29 March 2015');

(Although Alicia Witt single-handedly carried almost every scene she was in.) And the "Ava in prison" arc must have looked great on paper but in the real world it was relentlessly depressing.As we move into what has been announced as the final season, we could be in for some roadbumps, unless the production team rediscovers their inner fire in the belly.Nice to see Timothy Olyphant, a much under-rated actor, have an "Executive Producer" credit even though it is not clear what that means, other than the show is successful and he is the star...?

To me David Lynch is the greatest filmmaker that has ever lived and I mean no hyperbole by that statement. His films aren''t for everyone but there''s no denying that there''s nothing like them around, he''s simply incomparable to his peers. Watching his films is like viewing a painting or listening to a piece of music, there''s something inside of you which either likes it and accepts it or doesn''t.I am definitely more of a David Lynch fan than a Twin Peaks fan. For me, the episodes directed by the man himself are by far the strongest and most ground-breaking, particularly the final cliff-hanger episode which stands as one of the most fantastically immersive things Lynch has ever done. I also much prefer the dark, horrifying vision of Fire Walk With Me which departed from the jovial tone of the TV series, signified by the opening shot of a television being destroyed. However, there are still hardcore Twin Peaks fans who consider the film an abomination due to how drastically different the story and tone is. These same people are going to be incredibly frustrated by the opening of season 3.David Lynch seemingly (and tragically) disappeared from the edge of the Earth after the release of his impenetrable feature film, INLAND EMPIRE in 2006. So you can imagine my excitement when it was announced that Twin Peaks was going to come back with 18 episodes, all directed by David Lynch. That''s almost 18 hours of pure magic after over ten years of nothing Lynchian on our screens. The announcement was made back in 2014 so we''ve been patiently waiting for what feels like an age for Twin Peaks to come back on our screens and the other night it finally appeared! No one knew what to expect when the two-hour premiere was about to start. The production has been kept absolutely top-secret and the teasers released by Showtime barely show more than three seconds of new footage at a time. However, I can guarantee that no one in the world would predict how the opener turned out as it did. In typical Lynch fashion our expectations were completely and utterly subverted within the first ten minutes. Those expecting a cosy rehash of the original series must be incredibly disappointed because this is not the old Twin Peaks we know and love, however it is unapologetically the David Lynch we know and love.I was immediately reminded of Eraserhead in the opening five minutes which sees the kindly giant chatting with Dale Cooper in stark monochrome adjacent to a puffing gramophone. They''re in the iconic red room which they''ve been sitting in for twenty five long years. Everything about the scene has the director''s fingerprints all over it and it''s beautiful to see. The giant spouts total nonsense to an aged Cooper to which he responds, "I understand" a hysterical in-joke for Lynch fans. Things don''t become much clearer in the next 100 minutes.Shockingly, the premiere spends barely any time in Twin Peaks and is more interested in startling events surrounding New York, South Dakota and Las Vegas. Old characters are met fleetingly and with more weirdness than usual. The structure and atmosphere of the show resembles Mulholland Drive more than the original Twin Peaks as there are so many strange strands and subplots which all somehow relate to each other in intriguing and inexplicable ways. It''s interesting to think that most of the feature film, Mulholland Drive is actually a pilot episode; so this new season may give us a glimpse of what the shelved Mulholland Drive TV series could have looked like.Like most David Lynch films, the best way to experience it is to just go with the flow and ask questions later because nothing makes sense. It feels like we''re watching an explosion of Lynch''s unconscious mind on film, only I do believe that there is a solvable plot in there unlike the anarchic madness of INLAND EMPIRE. There are some extraordinary scenes of pure cinema which cannot be explained with words. The New York segment, for example, is utterly hypnotic and finishes with one of the scariest moments I have ever seen on screen thanks to nightmarish imagery and a terrifying sound design. I literally flew out of my seat, something I haven''t done since the tramp sequence in Mulholland Drive. There ', '23 May 2017');

And these muses blow their ears to that idea which is considered by them as the "idea that changes everything." Sometimes the idea changes everything, but sometimes it only gets in the way of things, because ideas that are considered very genius also often generate an inability to self-critique. They result in drastic changes in planning, renunciations, and quirky twists, and often result in a deep obsession of the creator with certain creatures.Now we can say that Chris Carter''s obsession is the CSM. There in the pilot of the show, the character appears in several episodes without saying a word, only smoking and little by little, was proving itself a key personage for the events of the conspiracy. Carter often twisted our patience with the subject''s "false deaths," but reached the height of ridicule when he brought him back after last year''s blast that literally showed the skeleton of his face before our eyes. And more than once the showrunner declared that this had been the definitive death, only to later change his mind about it when the revival was announced.This has implications, of course. Bringing the "villain" back meant it needed to fit him into the plot planned for the series. The problem is that it is an icon that goes back to the old mythology, which has already been solved and if we start to tell a new story, we need to understand what role that icon in it. So Carter had two paths: to focus on what is relevant to the world now and rebuild dramatic perspectives; or tweak the original mythology in search of a resource that would make possible the insertion of the CSM in the current plan. Carter chose the second option, insisted on the importance of a character already outdated and to reinforce that he is relevant, he fused the mythology and began to mess it up in dangerous and harmful ways.Who Cares?My Struggle III falls into the category of titles that transform premieres or season finales into trilogies. That once used to mean big things to the plot, but now the feeling is that the title should be Our Struggle. As soon as the episode begins with the Cancerous giving a monologue the atmosphere of error engulfs us with full force. It is a bit sad, as it would be to see someone who has lived great moments, trying to reproduce them exactly for the rest of their lives. The CSM has no more importance, no one else cares about him, he''s not a super-villain and acting as if his presence in the season was a big deal is pathetic.In writing and directing the episode, Carter does not deprive himself of looking like a teenager eager to frame all the symbols of the work itself in 42 minutes of action. He wants to do everything at once: either the CSM conspiring, or Scully in a hospital bed all the time so that Mulder seems afraid of losing it, or absurd "signs" appearing even on scans, or Skinner - after YEARS - still looking suspicious to Mulder, wants viruses, and the words "truth" and "answers" popping up every two sentences, want chase, want contemplation, whatever, and everything else he can get to show the audience he still knows how to do. But definitely he does not know.I felt personally offended by the tricky solution to solve the events of the last finale. The idea of making it all a "vision" of Scully puts the show into a box of imbecilities where soap operas have never imagined they would ever have something in common with The X-Files someday. And the mess continues ... One hour the CSM always protected Mulder, now wants to kill Mulder. The CSM wants a place in the main conspiratorial events, but also wants to exterminate the human race (and will continue to be able to dominate no one). The aliens once wanted a partnership with men, then wanted to dominate everything by themselves, now they do not care if men will or will not exist. Carter shoots in all directions, trapped in dramatic addictions that have been in the past, unable to comprehend what Mulder and Scully would have been like in an age where alien conspiracies no longer impress anyone.The poisonous cherry cake came in the "incredible plot twist" that reveals the doubts about William''s paternity. That''s wrong on so many levels that I do not even know where to start. Firstly, it puts Scully in a stalemate position that does not match the c', '11 February 2018');

They look just like ordinary people but they have the morals of crabs and will use any trick they can to get their hands on kiddies. Fearless reporter Chris Morris puts his subtlety and balance on hold and sets out with the help of many stars to expose the threat this overwhelming evil poses.My plot summary is an attempt at the humour that this special programme delivered, although I don''t think I can ever do justice to Chris Morris who may not be a genius but is certainly a very twisted individual. Before I review it, a little history. When this show came on the air it drew record complaints to Channel 4 and an entire storm of headlines from the Daily Mail (or, as some call it, the Daily Hate). At one point I got so annoyed by people like Mediawatch (Mary Whitehouse''s organisation) chasing the moral high ground that I wrote to the top man (forget his name) to defend the show and also point out that in the same paper he had given an interview (Daily Star I think), on the same day but a few pages later was a picture of Charlotte Church with a headline like "Making a Fresh Breast" and a bit of text about how she''s growing up nicely (if you know what I mean). Ironically she was 15 at the time.He wrote back and disagreed with everything of course, said he didn''t know about the Church thing (who''d have though the Star would letch after young women?) but was generally polite in the way that upper class English white men will always tend to be in letters. Anyway, my point at the time was that the show was not making light of paedophilia but was rather satirising the hysteria of the media in handling the subject, stirring up mob action and anger against anyone suspected of being a paedophile. Whether you think they all deserve to be shot or all require treatment in very secure facilities, this is still a valid point and the show succeeded in delivering it with Morris'' unique sense of humour.However it was all very, very sharp and dark and I understand why some viewers hated it (although Channel 4 actually got more compliments than complaints Â I was one of the former in an attempt to provide balance). It is a very serious subject and, although he was digging at the media, it does still give the impression of trivialising the issue. Morris was also accused of mocking the stars who were giving their time to a good cause but personally I thought they were part of the point Â that the outrageous things they were asked to say are only a few steps worse than the "truths" they are sold by the media normally. Perhaps the attacks on the media is part of the reason that the storm in the papers the next few days was so intense? Regardless this was classic Brass Eye and was as absurd and as clever a piece of satire as Morris was known for. Personally some of his stuff is a bit too "out there" for me (Jam and the like was not to my taste) but I love satire and his was generally imaginative, sharp and funny. The special will be remembered for years for the storm it kicked up but I hope that it is remembered as well for hitting a big ugly target bang in the middle.

I remember feeling that season 3 was a bit too pleased with itself for my tastes, and this is magnified here, where lots of increasingly famous and successful people are crowbarred into place to deliver this episode â and to be fair it must have taken a huge amount of schedule balancing to make it happen, so credit for that.I guess there was also the risk that this amount of effort, and the fact that the stars no longer really ''need'' Sherlock as a vehicle, means that there is a feeling of them doing the viewer a favor. As part of this as well, it must be tough for the writers, as they are trying to write an ongoing story without knowing when/if they will get the next episode. There is a sense of both these things with this episode, which occur in the few minutes that the plane takes to turn around and land so that the banished Sherlock can deal with the apparent return of Moriarty. In the jump back in time, we enter Sherlock''s mind as he tries to solve a similar mystery he read about. This jump back in time allows the writers to not have to worry too much about where/how to advance the Moriarty plot, while at the same time appearing to advance it. It also gives them a chance for a bit of fun away from the modern settings.And it is fun, in a way, although it is also heavy with flaws and weakness. The time-hopping doesn''t help the actual mystery which is the focus of most of the time, nor does it really fit in the modern setting either. This sense of it not really working, and not really doing much for the viewer also means that, while it is funny and entertaining, it does feel like it is overly pleased with itself at the same time. That sense of indulgence and knowing it is a big deal does come through â not heavily perhaps, but I did find it hard to shake. It is all still an expensive and impressive production technically, but it is messy and the fun elements come almost by force of personality rather than wholly by design.Sherlock is such a hot property for the BBC, and with the effort it must take to even get one episode made, you can see why they are happy with whatever. However, with this so-so episode coming on top of the equally below-expectations season 3, it does make you wonder realistically what the plans are for this. Hopefully they can work it out for a decent handful of episodes to be completed as part of bringing the series to a close in a meaningful way rather than limping ahead like rock stars playing half-assed gigs in small venues so they can ''keep in touch with their roots''.', '14 January 2016');

There will always be the divisive reviews with this show because of the creative divinity executed imo just like art, either you love it or hate it, theres not much middle ground. There are negative reviews about the this return season just like the movie fire walks with me, two things I preferred better than season 2 of the original series. I love the tone and overall grittiness of it. I loved fire walks with me. If you liked FWWM chances are you''re going to love this newer version of TP. I believe this is what Lynch intended without network restrictions and being in control of the whole series. I believe showtime did not interfere with this season at all and it shows with David Lynch fingerprints and DNA in all the right frames and shots. The inside jokes like Dale cooper telling the Giant in the very beginning he understands or when the two cops (one played by lynch himself) talks to the man at arrowhead behind the gate and he asks if hes free to go. Subtle things like that go a long way with me. 
I preferred the newer season even more for its complex presentation and making my brain tingle while stimulating it every second of watching it. I''ll get to every episode. The pilot was a flat out 10 imo. No one knew what to expect with a lot of anticipation and expectations and yet it didnt meet what anyone would have thought. Spending time less in Twin peaks? New York? South Dakota? The music is undeniably brilliant and the sound effects hieten this pilot. When Bob first enters with his drive in the night the music is fantastic!! All stories start in the middle and with Twin Peeks you bet each thing presented is going to feel like WTF but it pays off most of the time, the rest that doesnt is still worth it imo. 25 years later it starts with Laura Paulmer saying what she last said to Cooper. The black lodge is so incredibly surreal. What fascinated me was the glass box in NYC. That was intriguing and I cant wait to see what that''s about. And of course the murder that''s discovered was jarring. Forgive me for forgetting his name, but the actor who plays Bill Hastings does a brilliant job acting. The whole pilot is a masterpiece imo and surpassed my expectations letting me believe this season is going to be unlike anything on TV AGAIN! That''s why a 10 too. It reminds me why this show is groundbreaking! I could go on and on about the stunning and how incredible the sound is and how it affects the experience of watching it or the many other brilliant things.

But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads, but the message was widely misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. The show was purely about the media and it''s presentation of the subject. Morris, is and always will be, a media satirist. The notion that the program ''makes fun'' of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never attempts to do either such thing. He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming, and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject.Using many of his established ''Brass Eye'' characters, such as, Ted Maul and others, Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything Morris has done previously. Using his tried and tested formula, Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. In actuality, they are made to look like exactly what they are. Retards.All in all, the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed.

Having one of the most famous scientist and science translators (science language to bus driver language) of our time, Neil deGrasse as host, and an amazing staff supporting him (like MacFarlane who seems to be really critic about the reality we live in and a really great comedian and producer, the producer of the Original Series and ex-wife of Sagan: Ann Druyan, and the cinematographer of Matrix: Pope, among others) I wondered if it would carry too much fantasy, would it be way too historical, would it be the same stuff that you watch and hear daily on science channels and pod-casts about stars and the universe... How could they handle this? Well, somehow they did it!! And nonetheless with an amazing first episode example. They were able not only to conjugate actual science with probabilities and possible past and future scenarios (talking about space-time past/future) but (and I think these has something to do mainly with MacFarlane, Druyan and deGrasse) they also made some critics on how the religion is and has been a factor on science (bad influence mostly, obviously, but also as a motivator for those who think out of the box and want to know more no matter what). But that''s not all, they were able to present something different, even about history: they focused on an historical character to guide the story, that wasn''t one of the famous, that wasn''t that well known and these was one of the points that made it more interesting. Why? Because most of the people know about Galileo or Copernicus, and are familiar with their stories, so this little detail was able to capture even more my attention. About the science and the photography and special effects, well there''s not much to say but it can''t get any better (tough somehow I hope it will and I''m most certain that it will). It is a show that needs to be watched by these new generations, no matter if they like or don''t like the science side of the TV programming, it is a must!

No point in discussing specific reasons, there are just too many.2. Dexter living a life of superman: His ability to multi-task is insane and stupid.

Hanna is wanted by all yet doesn''t change her looks: This is something that has happened throughout the series. At least dye her hair! Seriously...she is a blond hottie...make some effort! This pisses me off...same result as above.4. "Make Your Own Kind of Music" Why use the same song used in LOST? Annoying. Weak writing. Another moment that took me out of the show.

These are not sketches that were cut from the last two seasons. These sketches were recorded for the third season, but Chapelle left before that season was complete. With one exception (which isn''t in this episode), Chapelle believed that these sketches were good.This new "season" is introduced by two actors from the other seasons. Their commentary between the sketches is mostly pointless, but the sketches are mostly hilarious. The first sketch, about people taking advantage of Dave for his money, is alright, but not hilarious.The second sketch, which is just a minute or so, is funny but somewhat obscure. It''s a reference to Wu-Tang''s first album, when they talk sarcastically about torture methods. Anyone familiar with the album will chuckle at this piece.The next two sketches really make the show. The first is about Dave seeking revenge on everyone who has wronged him. I won''t give the methods he uses away, but they are incredibly cruel, unexpected, and funny. This part reminded me of South Park''s "Scott Tenorman Must Die" episode.The last sketch references all the "new" Tupac songs that come out. In the sketch, Tupac mentions things he could not possibly have known about. Dave''s imitation of Tupac''s voice and style is dead-on.

And the answer was Sherlock who is obviously half Vulcan had retreated into the past in his mind to solve the mystery as to how Moriarty had returned.How could he still be alive and the answer was simple. He had fired another invisible gun at the floor whilst holding a gun to his head and a coven of hooded women had replaced his ''body'' with that of a dead lookalike. All as Sherlock stood there and watched.But of course that could not have happened so what was the point of Sherlock solving a period mystery that had nothing to do with his modern one?After solving the Bride mystery and digging up her modern grave Sherlock had an imaginary conversation with Moriarty at the famous Falls and then Watson, who had appeared out of nowhere, pushed him to his ''death''.There were elements of the period story that were good but as soon as it was revealed why we were there all that was forgotten. In the end Sherlock stated that Moriarty was indeed dead but he now knew what his next move was.

We didn''t even get to learn who the real murderers were, so what was the point again? The acting overall wasn''t bad, and the plot had some potential until mid way through, hence it''s a 3/10 and not 1/10. The sequences with Moriarty were also drawn out and unneeded, it would suffice if he had a 2 minute cameo in the end, to remind us of the 21st century, but lets leave it at that. Then the writers should have used the extra time to give us more closure in the 19th century. However my biggest concern was that according to the show, it''s okay to murder someone who hurt your tiny bitty feelings, as long as you are female. "Oh no he promised her money and status but he didn''t deliver so OBVIOUSLY the greedy gold digger had to kill him!". Who writes this trash, and how is any sane viewer supposed to sympathize with that? This isn''t even real feminism, feminism should be about equality in opportunities AND responsibilities! The women involved in the murders deserved a long long jail time!!! This is a warped version of feminism where females are exempt from the negative consequences of their actions. Instead of appearing progressive (which I assume was the goal), it perpetuates the problematic notion that women should be pandered to. Mary doesn''t come off as empowered when she speaks that way to john, the man she supposedly loves. She comes off as immature. To elaborate, saying you''d like to walk someone to their car is NOT grounds for an emotional fit. This is why shows should stick to one aspect (in this case Sherlock being a genius detective).

Set during the Elizabethan times, the show changes for the better as Ben Elton replaces Rowan Atkinson as co-writer alongside Richard Curtis. From here, a great deal of the jokes comes from the one-liners, as the humor now veers towards being more droll and sarcastic. We also see a change in Blackadder himself, as he is no longer the sniveling, cowardly schemer that he was in the first series but rather a slick, blissfully nasty S.O.B. that we would come to know and love. Altogether, these changes would help turn the show into one of the funniest British sitcoms of all time.In "BlackAdder II", we also see the return of Blackadder''s sidekick''s Percy and Baldrick, played by Tim McInnerny and Tony Robinson. However, this time Baldrick is now an imbecile just like Percy. You could say he has been "dumbed down" for the better, as he now becomes the perfect comic foil for Blackadder. Also among the supporting cast this time is Miranda Richardson, who is superb as the childish, execution-happy Queen Elizabeth. Also, Patsy Byrne, who is also a delight as Nursie. Not to mention, Stephen Fry as the grave Lord Melchett. Fry, along with Hugh Laurie, would later go onto becoming a regular for the rest of the BlackAdder sequels that follow."Bells" is the first episode of this second series. The plot uses the cross-dressing elements of Shakespeare''s "Twelfth Night." A girl disguises herself as a boy to seek a fortune in London and falls in love with her employer, Edmund Blackadder. However, when he finds that he is getting to close for comfort with his supposed "man-servant" and he becomes confused over what to do about it.The episode is immensely funny. The entire scene in beginning with Blackadder, Percy, Baldrick, and the arrows has pitch perfect comedic timing. Blackadder has some of his most witty lines here too ("This is *the* Jane Herrington? Jane "bury-me-in-a-Y-shaped-coffin" Herrington"), in fact just by him saying the word "Bob" it makes you laugh. The hilarity continues as we are later introduced to The Leech Doctor and followed then by "The Wise Woman." Let''s not forget the ending with Lord Flashheart, played by the late, great Rik Mayall. A truly zany character that upstages everyone when he appears on screen.All in all, "Bells" makes for a fine first episode for the second series, which marks a turning point where the show would only get funnier from here.', '6 April 2015');

Extremely little, for fear of spoilers.I will say that I loved it â I''d rate it a perfect 10, as I would just about any episode of this amazing TV show. Also, as good as the trailer was Â I can say that it offers much more in its story than you''d expect.I''d also say that it strongly, strongly parallels a movie that I happen to love â right down to its surprise plot device, key character interactions, and a symbolic act by the main protagonist in the climactic scene. The similarities are just too much for this to be a coincidence â it''s just got to be a well done (and a damn fun) homage. It''s unexpected, too, as the film I''m thinking off probably appeals to a different fan base. "The Abominable Bride" also cheerfully skewers another excellent recent film and the twist employed there.There''s some terrific acting, especially between Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and our main villain. And the dialogue is as sly and superbly delivered as always. I don''t think I''ve ever watched a new episode of "Sherlock" and not laughed out loud at least once. The stronger, more assertive John Watson (Martin Freeman) that we see is damn terrific. (There''s a compelling and sensible reason why this iteration of Watson seems a little different than our usual mild anti-hero, but I just can''t say why.)My quibbles were wholly forgivable. I thought that the Victorian versions of Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey) and Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) were just so cartoonish that they seemed right out of a "Saturday Night Live" sketch. It "took me out of the movie," and hampered my willing suspension of disbelief. It felt more like farce and silly sight-gags, instead of the dry, dialogue- and character-driven humor that the show is known for.I also though that the climactic scene occurring among three primary characters, felt a little Â off. Was it just not staged right? Was the pacing off? Maybe I got the sense that I was looking at a soundstage? I''m not sure.Finally, I am an inveterate horror movie fan, and I might have liked to have seen the director and screenwriters play up the horror story elements just a little bit more here. The mystery for this episode was a jewel of an opportunity â a garish, fearsome "ghost bride" that assassinates men. It could have been just a little scarier, given that story. I know that "Sherlock" is not a horror show, but its creators did just fine in making their adaptation of "The Hound of the Baskervilles" both a bit frightening and a proper mystery.But, again, those are just forgivable quibbles.

It was a stretch asking me to believe that he wasn''t destroyed by a missile in "The Truth" even though this was seen onscreen -- so in Season X they downplayed his injuries but at least showed that he was horribly disfigured. In "My Struggle III", this seems to have been completely retconned as well -- no more disfigurement, just an old man. Seriously, why not just tell us he was cloned? So in the same universe that he was destroyed by a missile, in Dana''s vision he appears as a disfigured survivor, then we''re told forget that -- in the real world, he''s healthy and unscathed, just older. Remember when Jeremiah Smith told him he had lung cancer in 1996? What happened to his cerebral issue from Season 7, then the illness he dealt with in "Requiem"? Never addressed -- outrageous.

Instead of condensing an already fantastic series of books, now the writing team is tasked with filling gaps and turning an outline into a coherent narrative. And thus, all the deficiencies (such as tropes, gaping plot holes, and predictability) of standard Hollywood screenwriting became apparent the in last couple of seasons.Many central characters such as Tyrion, the Hound, Daenerys and Jon Snow have progressively lost key aspects of their personality and become run-of-the-mill tropes. The terrible pacing simply exacerbates this issue as the show-runners attempt to go through a "check list" and juggle so many different arcs in a 45-50 min episode. The result is a complete lack of depth, character development, and very short scenes, and we the audience simply can''t get as emotionally invested in the characters as before.But, we can expect some key revelations tying up the story and fantastic CGI dragons and battles, so this will definitely be entertaining just not on par with earlier seasons.', '16 April 2019');

Following in the footsteps of the show in which he made his bones, (The Sopranos) creator Terrence Winter brought us to early 20th century Atlantic City. He presented us captivating characters such as Nucky Thompson, Margaret Schroeder, Nelson Van Alden, Arnold Rothstein, Richard Harrow and so many more. ***Some mild spoilers***Now four years removed from its first season, what does Boardwalk have to show for itself? An ever expanding universe that has gotten as far away from the Boardwalk as possible and that has jumped seven years into the future from season 4.Performances are still fantastic, the sets are incredible, the direction and cinematography are some of the finest in television (or film for that matter). The problem is now that the stories don''t seem to be going anywhere. Nucky is once again sleepwalking in life without any of his former foils (Jimmy, Eddie, Gyp, Eli, Chalky, the Commodore) to stir their proverbial drinks. His motivations (to sell rum from Cuba) isn''t captivating at all and there really is no clear and present conflict to what he is doing anymore. Things are lurking in the shadows, but all Nucky has now is Sally (they''re just business associates now), who doesn''t have the sensitivity of Nucky''s former squeeze Margaret, or the dripping sexuality and intrigue of Billie Kent.Nucky''s world has been dull since season 4 for the most part, and it doesn''t look like it''s going to be any different this year, at least thus far. There are also flashbacks that show Nucky''s rise into becoming the Commodore''s protÃ©gÃ©, but this Godfather II homage (The Godfather series is counted as some of the most influential works that Winter has paid homage to throughout his career) that juxtaposes young Nucky and present Nucky doesn''t really do much to give us new insight into the character. The events seen here give us knowledge that has already been told to us in prior seasons. In short, this regurgitation feels unearned and unnecessary.The only interesting part of this episode was Chalky''s storyline. Now a prisoner, Chalky was put through an emotional hell last year and is now an inmate. This part of the story was interesting and mysterious, and it appears that Chalky may have the majority of the tasty meat to chew this season as he did last season.The rest of the episode isn''t worth mentioning from a story standpoint, just know that we get to check in with Margaret who is still entirely unnecessary since the end of season 3. We also get to see Lucky Luciano''s ascension in the mafia, which once again, seems to have little to do with Nucky. Although, it seems like it will be linked to Nucky somehow if he ever gets back to Atlantic City.I will say this, I have been watching director Tim Van Patten''s work for 15 years in television. He''s one of my favorite directors in the business and I can say without a doubt, that this is his finest job directing from a technical standpoint in the history of his career.The shot selection is brilliant. Every shot is gorgeously presented and the performances and crispness of the editing is equally impressive. If you''re not a fan of Boardwalk, you should watch this just to see the technical brilliance on display in this episode. Kudos to him and cinematographer Jonathan Freeman for shooting the best looking episode of TV since Breaking Bad''s "Ozymandias". So, long story short: a slow and rather dull story for Nucky, interesting and mysterious material for Chalky and masterful technical craftsmanship.Grade: 7/10', '8 September 2014');

I get the feeling Lynch likes to do the complete opposite of what a pilot is supposed to do so that he can get rid of all the casual viewers. At least, that''s the only explanation I can think of for coming up with something as tedious as this episode was.

This is exactly why I can''t wait to finish this so I can move on to the second series from a few years ago, where every single episode is directed by Lynch. Right from the start, the room serviceman was just unsettling. It was funny at first, but Lynch loves to drag out situations like that, and the longer it goes, the more unsettling it becomes. There was a lot of tension formed in this episode just purely based on the fact that you have no idea what this man might come up with. Then after the weird old man who completely ignored the fact that Cooper was bleeding out on the floor, came The Giant, another strange but cool character. It''s this kind of surrealism which is why I like Lynch''s stuff so much. That being said, the more normal elements of this episode were also excellent. The scene with Ben and Audrey was genuinely making me cringe because the whole situation was just so creepy. At one point, Cooper made a nice speech as he was bleeding out, and I really like the inclusion of Diane and the tape recorder, an inventive substitute for a regular voice over. The episode was just full of really great character moments, like the return of Agent Rosenfield who really makes me laugh, Bobby and Shelly at the hospital, Bobby and his dad who made a really heartwarming speech, Audrey calling out to Cooper. Also, it''s like the silly over-the-top OST has come full circle, because at one point in the hospital where Norma was looking in at Ed and Nadine, that stupid music actually worked. These little character moments really gave the episode life. There wasn''t a whole lot in terms of plot, though there were a couple of leads. Of course, there was that simply horrifying final scene too. It''s the first actual real taste of the crime as it happened, and the imagery and sound were both just haunting.

This was one that I missed for some reason.After the show went off the air, a writer from Entertainment Weekly wrote about each episode of the show, ranking them in order. This was one of the lower ranked episodes and possibly the lowest ranked two part episode. This was due mainly to the treatment of the Borg. The once ultra cool cyborgs which to this day are still the most formidable foe of the Federation (I used the alliteration on purpose)were used so poorly. He referred to them as "the lost boys" of the galaxy, and the Peter Pan reference was accurate. The show never really makes clear what happened. Hugh explains that the Borg were of one mind and his individuality messed that up. This makes no sense whatsoever. If the Borg are incapable of taking away individuality and placing that mind into the collective, then the Borg cannot exist. Simply what they have been doing forever cannot be done with one Borg drone? And the argument that it couldn''t be done with Hugh because he is already a Borg is not valid either. They took the simplest thing the Borg are capable of doing and made them incapable of doing it. It was asinine. Beyond that, the episode seems to imply that this was an effect that affected the entire collective. It also implies that it was only these Borg. This sets off a chain of events that makes the Borg harder to understand. We start learning that the Borg ships individually are collectives not linked to the whole. Then we are told all ships are linked to the whole. It gets confusing, and it started with this sub average episode.But even putting the Borg to the side.

The introduction of Captain Darling ("What do you want, Darling?") and General Melchett is very funny, and to have Blackadder entering an art competition is an original idea, and one that is handled very well (there is a surprise truth about Lt. George revealed this episode). A great scene is Blackadder''s lying to Melchett and Darling about the portrait - it shows his true colours and desires, and depicts him as a cunning, yet unfriendly, man. The one slight problem is how Blackadder and George made up so fast after the lie, but we can forgive that, and a funny scene outside the trenches delivers one of the best comedy lines ever: (George asks "If we should happen to tread on a mine, what do we do?", to which Blackadder replies, "Well, normal procedure, Lieutenant, is to jump 200 feet into the air, and scatter yourself over a wide area." Hilarious!) The ending scene with Melchett and Darling is probably the best scene in the whole show, and shows that the episode has revolved around cooking even after branching out into art and escape from the trenches.On the whole - Captain Cook is a great episode, and shall be remembered for its great one-liners and the fact that it was the start of Blackadder''s best series.

If you have not watched the 1st episode of "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey", please go and watch it before reading this review. You have been warned.* This episode introduces us to the narration of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, an accomplished astrophysicist and an individual tasked with taking us on a journey through the universe and helping us to know how we came to understand our origins and our place in the cosmos, much in the same vibe as the late astrophysicist Carl Sagan did when he took television audiences on a similar journey in the original Cosmos mini-series back in late 1980.Overall, when focused on the ever bountiful knowledge of scientific establishment, the episode is mostly successful. Tyson takes the viewer on a new incarnation of the "Spaceship of the Imagination" through an overview of our "cosmic address", the Observable Universe. Later on, he also goes through a re-collection of the cosmic calendar, an aspect from the original series but more thoroughly explored here. Between various quips, and cool responses to events like the Cretaceous asteroid reveal, Tyson shows some depth of charisma and personality that fits the tone of the show and is a good followup to Sagan''s presentation. I leave the comparison of both to the reader, but personally I feel such a thing would be a disservice to both. They are interesting in their own ways.Unfortunately though, the episode isn''t without it''s flaws. The writing seems disjointed or paced awkwardly at times, which could be because the general sense of a connected narrative isn''t present like in the original series. The music, composed by Alan Silvestri, is decent but definitely lacks the impact that Vangelis had for the original. This is a shame, since Silvestri is an accomplished composer with great work under his belt.However, where the episode really falls flat is in it''s historical recounting of a scientific individual, something that the original series was known for. Here, the Italian theologian and philosopher Giordano Bruno is discussed. However, such a recounting works against the scientific vibe of the show, as Bruno''s ideas and eventual persecution and execution were mostly as a result of religious dogma and expression, something the episode doesn''t make clear to the viewer. Tyson himself blatantly mentions that Bruno didn''t have any scientific basis for his ideas, in fact just "guessing right". Once again, this is counter to the goal that the series sets out to accomplish, which is popularizing science and it''s various steps. That isn''t brought forth through discussing Bruno''s life. Galileo Galilei or Thomas Digges, both of whom lived at around the same time as Bruno, would have been a more suitable individual to discuss. With such a missed opportunity, it leaves a question as to how the rest of the series will handle such historical sequences, but it remains to be seen. The idea to go with cartoon sequences isn''t bad, as in fact the parts are well-animated, although overdone dialogue and potentially inflammatory snubs at religious symbols hinted in the animation could be nixed.Despite these points, Cosmos is intent on focusing on scientific topics, and here it sets off on a good note. There is material here to intrigue viewers, and it will be interesting to see what the rest of the series holds regarding them. The final scene where Tyson recollects his meeting with Sagan in his earlier years, as well as the homage given to Carl, was poignant and touching and definitely serves to connect the series, and the host, with their predecessors. Despite the flaws, Cosmos looks like good potential to be beheld. We''ll see what comes next.Rating: 8/10', '10 March 2014');

The show had a shift from unpredictable, well-written, developed seasons in 1-6 into a rushed mess in 7. This episode kicks off Season 8 in the same fashion.Sadly, the only thing that surprises me on this show any more is how the writers continue to disrespect and dumb down many of the characters they (or GRRM) built for the first 5 or 6 seasons. Example 1: I know Bran is the Three Eyed Raven now, but really?? He''s just being weird for no reason. He can know things AND have at least a trace of the same characteristics that he had in the other seasons. Instead he''s this meloncholy stump that is not enjoyable to watch at all. He''s only used as a device to reveal things that the show doesn''t have time to spell out any more. Example 2: I have no clue why the writers have decided to make Sansa out to be someone she isn''t. Arya literally says Sansa is the smartest person she''s ever met. Sansa? I mean she isn''t dumb by any means, but after watching the previous episodes, I would not give her the right to say "you know I used to think you were the most clever man in Westeros." To TYRION! Tyrion was an incredible "game player" in the early seasons. He''s very smart. Now the show has reduced him, as they did to my guy Littlefinger, to someone he isn''t. Getting dissed by Sansa...never thought I''d see it. I could go on and on about how every character on the show just seems to be acting out of character- and it''s not their fault, it''s the dialogue and plot written. People are doing things they just never would''ve done previously.Another thing I really disliked about this episode: the dragon scene with Jon and Dany. What was that? It was like something you''d see in some corny movie. That was not Game of Thrones material...(why did they even go flying anyways, they had just said how the dragons had barely been eating, and hated the North, why waste their little energy by flying further North?) the cheesy dialogue along with the dragon being behind them as a punchline made this feel like How to Train Your Dragon or a Disney film.Overall this episode was just corny, sloppy, and boring.

However, like recent Doctor Who episodes, a firework display was advertised whilst the equivalent of lighting a BBQ being delivered.Metaphors aside, the episode started off with a "previously on Sherlock" display just in case we forgot what happened in the long... LONG wait since the last one. I personally didn''t enjoy that but I let it slide considering I could''t remember half the stuff in previous episodes anyway. Then it was time for the actual episode. And wow did it start off great! Revisiting the first episode almost word-for-word, except in 1890. That was clever. Then the plot was introduced, classic Sherlock envisioning the crime scene as it was described and the VFX team having a field day with the wizard effects. Nice.The rest of the episode was actually alright. Brilliant cinematography, purposely disorientating the audience. Clap for you BBC. But then Sherlock woke up in the present day on the plane from S03E03. What? Wait, what? Oh he was in his mind palace the entire time... But was he? This was the part that I felt Steven Moffat was reading a tonne of fan-fiction on one screen, writing on the other with "Inception" playing on his TV in the background. But this wasn''t clever. It was horrid, I had no idea what was going on! That is what I didn''t enjoy at all. To finish it all off, in the modern era, they start to play the credit music, then jump back to 1890 with Sherlock discussing his version of the "future" with Watson before flying out of 221B Baker Street revealing the modern city era again. Make up your mind! My point is. Stop making your episodes so complex that it''s impossible and irrational to understand it. I am no simple man, I just enjoy flicking on the TV and watching some rational television from a previously brilliant series. This isn''t Doctor Who, no more time travel please.

This was my mom''s favorite TV show I wasn''t a fan but watching it now since they are planning all new Twin Peaks Revival 2017 TV series and I am hooked. It was my mom''s favorite TV show before she past away 10 years ago and my co worker who is also my best friend is her favorite TV show too. This show has everything awesome cast of good actors, mystery, suspense, horror, thriller, supernatural, demons, spirits, humor, everything. No wonder the show has 8.9 on IMDb. Kyle MacLachlan as Special Agent Dale Cooper is incredible, this is one of his best performance ever! Watch Season 1 Episode 7 in which Dale Cooper finds naked Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) in his bed room and he doesn''t throw her out of his room , or having sex with her, he showed us that he is a human being and a real gentleman, I have ever saw on TV show or in any movie. The classic score by Angelo Badalamenti "Twin Peaks", is a beautiful score I love it. David Lynch is fascinated and brilliant director I have ever saw he has the best story in cinema history. Twin Peaks is an American television serial drama created by Mark Frost and David Lynch that premiered on April 8, 1990, on ABC. It was one of the top-rated shows of 1990, but declining ratings led to its cancellation after its second season in 1991. Season 2: "Episode 8" also known as "May the Giant Be with You", is the first episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Twin Peaks. The episode was written by series co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost, and directed by David Lynch. The plot has a humor incredible mystery that you keep guessing what secrets Laura did had and who killed her? This episode has heart and soul we see Dale Cooper ling on the floor of his hotel room after being shot in the stomach and the waiter keeps bugging him and they have such a beautiful funny dialogues that I was laughing. We find out a lot with people''s lives that happened from the end of the first season: Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) was shot, Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was strangled, the mill burned, Shelly Johnson (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance)got smoking hallucinations. Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) and Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) are missing and Nadine Hurley (Wendy Robie) is in the coma for taking sleeping pills. It starts strong and ends with a shocking and scary vision of Laura is been killed. I can''t wait for Season 2 to watch it all episodes. May the Giant Be with You is the best start of Season 2 it is my favorite and episode. It is a classic masterpiece including whole TV series I love it to death. Bobby visits Shelly in the hospital and she express her feelings to him and so does he, it is a touching scene, than Bobby reconnects with his father in a surprisingly touching scene that comes out of nowhere. There are more cryptic clues to remember in a viewer''s quest for the killer. And, there are more characters added in it is a fill of thrill.

Back in the 90''s fans didn''t give a shit about the petty issues that arise in some of these reviews. Of course fans were jarred or shocked here and there, but that was all part of the fun. It''s one thing to talk about it and get emotionally charged in fan discussion, but to write the show off because it "shocked" or "disappointed" them, after the first episode????

Don''t get me wrong, I love when expectations and predictions come to fruition, but if that happened all the time, things would get boring. The fact that after 26 years I can still jump out of my chair and yell "wholly shit" is a testament to how great this show still is. The fact that fans are upset that CSM impregnated Scully, or at the least said he did is rediculous. It''s a classic X-Files scenario that nobody expected. It''s not rape, it''s science fiction.

As far as the story goes, the only thing of significance to the plot that happened was Theon''s rescue of Yara. Well, I suppose that was significant. It would have been a lot more significant if the Battle of Winterfell had been lost. It''s not explained how Theon was able to rescue Yara from the flagship of a massive fleet, but okay.The sequence with Danyeras'' army coming to Winterfell was not bad, conceptually... but it felt like a squandered opportunity. The characters said nothing important. They just like cracking boring jokes, making blatantly obvious, but apparently clever remarks, and acting smug and elitist towards a people who are rightfully suspicious of MORE armies coming to their sorrowful lands.It''s a bit depressing that Sansa comes off as the most lordly and wise character among this pitiful assortment, since her most notable accomplishments in life have been alternating between being tormented and being rescued. I mean, her character is probably the most successful of the episode, but it doesn''t seem quite right. Probably just because of the way everyone else is acting.It seemed pretty reasonable at first that the northern lords should bow to Danyeras, but she acts so annoying that it really does cause instant dislike...
"what do dragons eat?"
"whatever they want" /smugface
Seriously... that was a reasonable question. Whatever.The plot thread with Lord Umber was a waste of time. I''m not sure why they sent the child back into the growing night at such a late hour. Did they just resent him because of his House''s support for the Boltons? Let''s be honest, it was just an excuse to cram the episode full of more filler. The jolly company teleports to Last Hearth to search for him, I guess? I didn''t know what was happening. Did my TV turn off? Because I can''t see a thing, I don''t know where they are supposed to be, and I don''t know why they are there since nobody mentioned anything about this prior to it happening. Thank goodness for Beric Dondarrion''s flashlight sword or I would have just stared into a black screen for the entirety of the "Last Hearth" scene.
What was the point of the scene anyways? "It''s a message from the Night King." Ohhhh, okay. Mr. Night King wanted to say, yo dudes, I''m freaking spooky, I nail children to walls, ooooh. Is this to convince us that the Night King is the bad guy? Seriously, how does this advance the plot at all? It just makes it make less sense. Because if the Night King''s army is already past Last Hearth, why would he go to the trouble to leave a message for the heroes to find? I guess he knew they would come looking for Insignificant Character #002789.. oh, I mean Ned Umber.. and so he would go to the trouble to make his sigil out of body parts so the heroes would know that he was a real spooky dude. Why? The Night King never even speaks, but he has enough of a personality to leave sadistic modern art laying around? If he knew someone would find his "message", then why would he not have some wights lying in wait to kill the heroes that he knew would come there and become stuck in the middle of his advance? Hmm. Doesn''t really make sense.
And then they make a point of saying they only have a few horses and they''ll have to ride double and try to ride hard to get past World War Z. Then it''s never mentioned again. I guess they just wanted to be safe, incase they ended up needing to insert another filler scene of a chase.
Actually, they could have done something interesting with that in the second episode. They could have come riding towards Winterfell being chased by hundreds of wights on exhausted horses at the end, thus giving us a reason for the sounding of the horns (instead of them just randomly sounding the horns for no conceivable reason, since only the audience can see the Others approaching) and maybe even giving the Dothraki a chance to show their quality by coming to their rescue. No? Oh right, if they did that, they couldn''t have Tormund flirt with Brienne.Well, back on topic... I thought the scene with Jon and Danyeras frolicking on their dragons was seriously ridiculous. It''s not like we''re facing the end of the world. It''s not like we have anything important to do. It''s not like we''re both known for being nobles who are supportive of the commoners.

The headmistress, Mrs. Deardorff, is stern rather than tyrannical. Jolene does impressive work, and while she is young and at times wooden, young Beth is inscrutable in a way that is very hard to pull off. Bill Camp was the standout.

In Twin Peaks, Dr. Jacoby receives a shipment of shovels. At the Great Northern, Ben Horne introduces his brother Jerry to his new secretary, Beverly, and chastises him for consuming too much of the marijuana the brothers now traffic legally. Deputy Chief Hawk gets a call from the Log Lady, Margaret, who cryptically tells him something is missing, which relates to Dale Cooper, and the key to finding it has something to do with Hawk''s heritage. In New York City, Sam Colby, a young man, has a peculiar job to pay for college, sitting in a large warehouse watching a glass box at the centre, periodically changing SD cards in the cameras monitoring the box as well. His girlfriend Tracey visits him with coffee. Though he is not allowed to let visitors into the room, the security guard is absent during Tracey''s second visit. The young couple have sex in front of the glass box, when a faceless, translucent entity finally materializes inside of it, breaking out and mauling them to death. In South Dakota, the physical form of Dale Cooperânow a sinister, long-haired man with black irisesâretrieves two associates named Ray and Darya for an unspecified task. Police find a local librarian in the South Dakota town of Buckhorn, Ruth Davenport, murdered with her decapitated head placed on the headless body of an unknown man. The fingerprints of the local school principal, Bill Hastings, are found all over the scene and he is promptly arrested. Bill denies any guilt but fumbles his alibi, casting further suspicion on him.Analysis: I believe that the good Dale Cooper from the Black Lodge will try to face his evil doppelganger and that the Log Lady''s message is a way to try to help the good Special Agent Dale Cooper to prepare his return safely. I think Bill Hastings is possessed by a similar entity as BOB and committed the two crimes without actually remembering them. Sam and Tracy must have been killed by an entity from the Black Lodge that has been provoked by their sexual intercourse. The evil Dale Cooper seems to plan a way to avoid going back to the Black Lodge and might try to use Darya and Ray for his plans. Only one of the two Dale Coopers might survive and they will probably try to exterminate each other or to fusion in a most schizophrenic way. This means that one might have to deal with at least three antagonists: the evil Dale Cooper, the possessed Bill Hastings and a violent entity from the Black Lodge. The main protagonists seem to be Dale Cooper, The Log Lady and Tommy "Hawk" Hill so far.Description: Even though twenty-six years have passed since the last episode of the second season, the first episode of the groundbreaking television series picks the audience up where it was left such a long time ago. The episode even starts with a flashback of a conversation between Dale Cooper and Laura Palmer in the Black Lodge that took place in the previous episode twenty-six years earlier. Several mysteries from the past are resolved while the series obviously introduces plenty of new questions. The most important element is that Dale Cooper is still caught in the Black Lodge while his evil doppelganger has been on a killing spree. The first episode introduces new and mysterious characters like Darya and Ray who help Dale Cooper''s evil twin. It also shows what has happened to several characters from the first two seasons such as the Giant and the One-Armed Man in the Black Lodge but also the Log Lady and Deputy Hawk in the real world who are still investigating the mysteries in and around Twin Peaks. The first episode also introduces us to strange events happening in the states of New York and South Dakota. A total of four characters are getting or are found murdered in the first episode. The tone is as sinister as it has always been. The images are gloomy, the camera work is hypnotizing and the soundtrack is numbing. The acting performances are memorable. Among the new characters, I liked Melissa Bailey''s quirky character and among the older characters, a thoughtful Deputy Hawk has much more screen time than in the first two seasons. This opening episode isn''t as memorable as the opening episodes of the previous two seas', '13 June 2017');

Not only it surpasses it''s predecessor, it elevates and evolves the documentary genre of television to a whole another level. In roughly an hour, you are exposed to imagery that previously wasn''t believed to be able to be caught on film whatsoever. I still do not understand how some of the shots the film crew captured were possible. With a little documentary at the end of the episode showing how insane and life threatening situations had the crew endure during the shoot, I cannot but wonder at the craft and care given to this documentary.David Attenborough takes us around the world''s most known, but also unknown islands to witness how the most interesting and rare breeds of animals live. It seamlessly blends small stories of said animals into a coherent narrative that urges you to observe how fragile balance is today''s nature facing. Along with beautiful footage, you are presented with excellent structure, as if each animal had a script to follow. The narrative is just pitch perfect, the emotions are bursting from the screen and the beautiful soundtrack only elevates the strength of the material.You will laugh, you will be close to tears, you will bite your nails throughout the action, you will collect your lower jaw from your carpet and by the end, you will be fully transported by the incredible adventure this documentary offers. Even if you do not care and never seen a documentary in your entire life, I suggest to give this one a go, because at times I thought I was watching a CGI scripted movie, and not a documentary that merely attempts to capture the reality. Perhaps it only means that this documentary finally succeeds on capturing that, which all the other documentaries about our planet desired to reach.If you live on planet Earth, make sure you watch this. 10/10', '24 September 2019');

While there may be many dissenting opinions that in turn opine the new Sherlock to be a 21st century masterpiece, I would on any given day watch a Jeremy Brett episode sipping on steaming hot coffee , while the snow falls on the deodars , right outside the window. The director of the series finally decided to yield to temptation and shoot an episode set in the 19th century world of Sir Doyle. At the beginning the whole effort did seem worth a watch, but no sooner than 20 minutes into the thing that one realised the futility of nursing expectations. It is extremely hard to decipher whom is this show trying to deceive? The screenplay may have been exquisite at the beginning , but now I am afraid it is not even pedestrian. The plots have been fabricated to such an extent that they look incredulously stale and silly. Worse still, is the insistence of projecting and presenting these mediocre exhibitions as a superlatively intelligent play , which basks in its own pretentious glory. I stopped watching this series after the end of the second season (or perhaps towards the end of it) because I could no longer tolerate seeing painfully simple stories being passed off as intellectually complex puzzles. Lo behold! when I am searching something on google I see this " I spent $30 to watch The Abominable Bride" . I am not proud of the fact but I was once again swindled by the hype created this show.

"The Fall" re-starts next week although it is my least anticipated of the three, while "Luther''s" comeback was very good but this dazzlingly brilliant episode was the best thing I''ve watched this Christmas.The writing really was terrific with a plot that had more ups and downs than a mountain range, more ins and outs than Hampton Court Maze and more twists and turns than a dozen corkscrews, in short it was a triumph. Starting with a Victorian-era impossible murder with an even more impossible murderer, guest appearances by all the previous supporting cast including a massively-bloated Mycroft, surely a homage to Sydney Greenstreet and the return of the master-criminal we''ve all missed, a premonition of another husband-slaying in a big old house after dark, a recreation of the real Reichenbach Fall climax of yore, an ingenious denouement anticipating female suffrage years later but perhaps the best thing of all was the promise of a new series to come.As ever, the technical aspects of the production were great, I''m a sucker for the multiple camera-angle, 360 degrees perspective, time-freezing, computer graphics and microscopic zoom shots employed. There was humour a-plenty and hosts of references to the Conan-Doyle original, including, if I''m not mistaken, the first time this Sherlock has ever said "Elementary my dear Watson".The playing by Cumberbatch, Freeman and Andrew Scott as the three main protagonists was never better. I''m sure there will be Sherlock-oligists who can pick apart the complexities of the plot, which for sure seemed at times like a read-across from Moffat and Gatiss''s other re-creation Dr Who, but let them, they won''t spoil it for me.

All the chaos and tragedy will continue to happen regardless.Adult Jonas once said to Jonas, "our father, Mikkel, is one small part of this convoluted plot." At first that line didn''t make sense and even now it doesn''t make sense because Mikkel in the alternate universe doesn''t go back in time so that he can father Jonas, which would mean that he actually isn''t a small part of the plot but rather the opposite.

He is a good actor and a creepy human being.This episode is a bit of a mess. As other people have remarked here, everything seemed to be wrapped up a bit too tidily. Data, who seemed quite psychopathic in most of the first episode and until the final few minutes of this episode, suddenly realizes that maybe doing Nazi-like experiments on his friends is bad because.... ummm, the episode''s runtime is almost over, I guess.Data''s personality in this two-part set is extremely disturbing. It taints whatever goodwill we had for his character. When he receives mild doses of feelings from Lore his reaction is to kill or torture to continue to receive more doses. If you believe that Lore is stripping his autonomy from him by this method, you are let down when you see him beg for more of it when he begins to return to a robotic mindset. I also remember that when his emotion chip was active in the movies he seemed like a cowering imbecile. In other words, when Data is left to his own devices, he seems unlikeable and maybe even abhorrent.I enjoyed the return of Hugh, yet as other people have noted here, his story about how his newfound autonomy almost destroyed the Borg was confusing.This show''s good acting is almost ruined by writers who didn''t seem to know what they were doing-- writers who caused us to question our fandom for Data.', '10 August 2018');

Set ostensibly in two time periods Sherlock''s mystically brilliant but ridiculously bloated pudding of a brother says ''a virus in the data'' whilst we are in Victorian London during Sherlock''s drug-induced mental time travel trip. Notwithstanding my Kruger in Disneyland comment this was more a mixture of a Brian Rix farce and a poor Dr. Who episode (or Harry Potter on an LSD trip) than a serious attempt to continue the series in its original entertaining and thoroughly engaging format. Bluntly, if the future episodes follow this Gothic nonsensical format it''s a series I will not be watching in the future. I am however clinging to the hope that this episode was presented as a purposely whacky new years piece of ''entertainment'' for minds that were already in something of an alcohol induced debilitated state. Time will tell.

After seeing the writers admit their mistakes from last season, I was more optimistic about season 3, but feared that maybe the magic of the first two seasons would be lost without the Westworld in WESTWORLD. Based on this extended premiere episode, it seems that my assumptions were mostly correct - but that''s not necessarily a bad thing.
THE GOOD:
* The addition of Aaron Paul as Caleb is welcome; his character is interesting, perfectly cast, and feels like a great window into this new age of WESTWORLD.* The future world is mostly believable; there are some technologies here that require some suspension of disbelief, but generally this world doesn''t seem too distant from our own.* The opening scene was light on substance, but was a very fun introduction to what the show is about moving forward.* The duality of Bernard - his ability to activate and deactivate himself at will especially - was cool and very well-utilized. The notion that he is possibly lying to himself and has absolutely no idea, too, was fascinating.
THE HMM:
* As previously mentioned, some of the new technologies are a little hard to swallow. Dolores zooming in on Liam''s meeting with her sunglasses and being able to hear the conversation clear as day got a good eye-roll out of me.* Too many new threads were introduced in this episode. Characters, new and old, thrust into situations without enough explanation given as to their motivations or reasons for being where they are. It felt like an entire episode was just missing.* Plot armour is a neverending trope in media, and, sadly, WESTWORLD is privy to it too.* Dialogue has never been one of this show''s strong suits; a pretentious program such as this one (I don''t mean that in either a good or bad way, that''s simply what it is) is always subject to instances of painful dialogue. A lot of lines felt forced and/or overdramatic, which removed me from the world a bit.THE BAD:
* Poorly structured and poorly paced. PARCE DOMINE features, hazarding a guess, 30 minutes of Caleb, 30 separate minutes of Dolores, 2 minutes of Charlotte, and 5 minutes of Bernard. If Nolan and Joy insisted this be a more simple just-Caleb-and-Dolores premiere, I wouldn''t have a problem, but the pacing is disjointed by the occasional cut to someone uninvolved with the main story.
Overall, a slick and engaging finished product that naturally lacks some of the magic that made seasons 1 and 2 feel special. Sharp and entertaining, but not WESTWORLD - but maybe that''s not such a bad thing. Season 2 began to collapse underneath its own weight, so it''s probably a good idea they decided to shake things up. Give the season more time and I see this becoming just as much a polished and engaging show, if for different reasons than the preceding years.', '16 March 2020');

The show begins with a crazy old man telling his grown daughter that they are penniless and she has to go to work...as a prostitute. But, she has different plans--to become a man-servant to some rich guy. Naturally, this leads to her going to work for Blackadder--a more handsome and despicable incarnation of the same character from the first series.Unfortunately for Edmund, he and his new ''boy'' get along too well--so well that he begins having carnal thoughts about ''him''. This leads to some funny scenes and confusion of his part, though eventually it all works out as Bob (as she called herself) is lady. They fall in love and decide to marry.

Then after he realizes this is the same rehab Sarah Lynn spent time at, he tries to form a more positive attitude. Yet he still seems to avoid talking about his problems.
After unintentionally helping a patient escape, BoJack feels responsible to go with her, not wanting the same thing to happen with her as with Sarah Lynn.This was a very attention-grabbing season premiere. We first get the police investigation after Sarah Lynn is found dead, and a cop asks BoJack about what happened, which of course he lies about and tells him he found her dead when he got there. I''ve got an eerie feeling this old case won''t rest for that much longer.The scenes at the rehab center were interesting, not to mention very funny. BoJack''s habit of going off on random tangents of course is a hindrance for him to talk about any of his issues seriously. One thing that stood out to me is how closely the part at the rehab where he roasts everyone mirrors the flashback at the party where he makes fun of his party guests. In both instances he goes too far and hurts someone personally.Unlike That''s Too Much, Man!, nothing bad actually happens when he goes with Jameson on her venture. Instead of passively tagging along having some drinks along the way, he does his very best not to have any alcohol at all and begs her not to drink either. That doesn''t mean he''s not tempted, but he''s learned how to hold back. For now at least. Yet what we get is very fascinating. Every time BoJack sees a bottle in his sight, he starts thinking back on all the times he drunk alcohol as young. At first we see an assistant egging him to drink to better perform a scene in Horsin'' Around, so it''s easy to assume that peer pressure to perform better is the reason he started. But as it goes further and further back, you start to realize the therapist back at the rehab was right. The drinking problem really isn''t his fault. The part where he takes a sip from a vodka bottle and then happily falls asleep in his mother''s lap is a sweet moment contrasted with a very dark image.When it comes to Jameson, you first get a picture of her having a similiarly troubled upbringing, where her father cares more about his movie memorabilia than her. As it turns out however, that isn''t the case at all. Instead, he cares deeply about her and is worried that she''s never gonna get better. He''s even forced to take care of her new baby since she can''t do it herself. She lies about the cause of her drinking and refuses to deal with her own problems. BoJack even catches her trying to sneak a bottle back into the rehab when he urges her to go back there. It reflects his younger self in a lot of ways, where he refused to deal with his own problems and would rather drink all his pain away.At the end, BoJack stares at the vodka-filled water bottle he confiscated from Jameson.

The episode starts by showing us what will become one of our primary characters and how the ramifications of the event that we are about to see unfold affected him in the years to come. It''s a great way of intriguing those who might not know as much about Chernobyl as well as make them wonder if his past justifies the drastic measures he takes. We then cut to a minute before the explosion where we see a fireman and his pregnant wife. The wife notes how there is a strange glow to the air as the husband brushes it off as the tar reacting from the roof, unaware that it''s the radiation from the core meeting the oxygen. This unawareness displayed by the civilians is one of the things that makes this episode so haunting, a scene later shows a group of civilians, families, wives, husbands, sons and daughters watching from a bridge at the explosion as radioactive ash lands on their skin. This scene is chilling but beautifully shot and will forever be imbedded in my mind. Equally horrifying in it''s own right is the more immediate threat at Chernobyl itself and the workers attempts or lack there of to cool the exposed core. We see peoples skin come up in rashes as the mere sight of the core and peoples skin melting from prolonged exposure, it''s awful and uncomfortable to watch but still expertly acted, written and shot. Meanwhile we see the firemen arrive and the graphite that was being used to slow the neutrons within the core, one of the firemen picks a piece of graphite up (bare in mind it was previously in direct contact with boiling, pure, uranium 235) his hand is instantly effected and within a minute the skin on his hand has melted away to the muscle and bone. We also get the equally distressing if less graphic scenes with the politicians who don''t fully grasp the weight of the situation and neglect the safety of innocents to prevent the spread of harmful or disinformation. Scenes like these often fall behind wether it be the lack of visual prowess or just poor writing but the acting AND writing here is just as if not more gripping than the rest. The episode ends with shots of the vibrantly coloured greenery and bustling playgrounds of schools as the black, deadly, radioactive smoke fills the sky in the distance and a bird falls to the concrete, twitching until it is dead. Having this juxtaposition of life and death really helps hit home just how quickly and unexpectedly the people of Pripyat, Ukraine, Belarus and the world''s lives changed.

I was checking the personnel involved to see if there had been some drastic change but couldn''t find anything, so I''m not quite sure what happened, but the end result is nonetheless an abject train wreck. Remember how Suicide Squad was a disaster because it was a full-length movie edited like a music video? Well, that springs to mind watching this episode. Again, the number 1 culprit is the editing. The entire episode is edited like a trailer or music video, it''s truly bizarre. There are never-ending jump cuts, pans and zooms and an incredible pace. No scene can be static for more than a few frames. Add to this there is literally music playing 100% of the time - there is never silence for the entirety of the episode and you have what looks like a YouTube edited trailer or music video except running for the entire episode; it is truly bizarre. I''m assuming something has gone horribly wrong with the editing process and the way the episode was cut, I''m truly aghast and can''t explain or understand how this happened. I know much of modern culture is culture without a pause, it is intended to gratify audiences instantly and never let up, but is this really the direction this show wants to go in?

History buffs are certainly going to love this episode as it takes its time but fully explains everything that was happening in the country during 1860 and 1861 and it gives you a clear idea of why both sides thought war was the only hope for their sides. The documentary also does a terrific job at showing why both sides also thought that the war would only last a few months with even a few people thinking that no one would have to die. The film uses narration to tell its story as well as actors (Jason Robards, Morgan Freeman) to do parts of various characters.

Now I can''t see it without being aware of how many of the actors have gone on to distinguished acting careers. Having said that, all of the actors, whether in small or large parts, do very well. Even Colonel Sink, who is played by a real life military officer, is solid in his performance. David Schwimmer has the toughest role to play in this first episode. His character, Captain Sobel, feels - we might think it is because he is conscious of his Jewishness - that he must work his men harder than the other company commanders so that he is recognized as a worthy officer. Unfortunately, his insecurity makes him a vacillating field commander. While some recognize that he has trained his men to be tougher than any other unit, his men both resent his martinet style and are disturbed by his inability to lead in the field. They are genuinely afraid that he will get his men killed. His sergeants risk being executed by mutinying against him. In a way, they do act dishonorably. If their actions had not led Colonel Sink to realize that Sobel is a walking morale problem who needs to be relieved of his command, the sergeants being transferred to better led units would have abandoned the rest of the men of E Company to meet their fates with Sobel.My favorite sequence - not a happy one - is when Lt. Winters first sees the sergeants leaving headquarters after they have been dressed down and reassigned. They salute Winters (they respect him to the same degree that they do not respect Sobel), and he returns their salutes. He knows something is up, but the sergeants kept him out of the loop, so he doesn''t know what just happened. A little later, Winters sees Capt. Sobel being driven away in a jeep right after he has been transferred in a wrenching scene. (Sobel squirms as he unconvincingly tries to explain to Col. Sink why his entire staff of non- commissioned officers mutinied against him.) Winters salutes Sobel in the jeep. Whatever Winters thinks of him, Sobel is still his commanding officer - or so Winters still believes. Yet Sobel doesn''t return the salute, may not even see Winters. Winters again senses that something is up, but, again, he doesn''t know what. (You can read so much that isn''t explicitly stated just from the acting - that is a sign of the quality in this production.)This is a good start for a series that I have not seen since it originally appeared on HBO sixteen years ago. I want to watch the rest of it and intend to do so.

I was very excited when I heard season 4 is coming and watched every episode of all 3 seasons twice, before the new premier. However, I was extremely disappointed that all the things I loved most about this series was diminished, and my expectations were not met in any degree because of the story line introducing and emphasizing on the modern day political BS we cannot escape, even through talented animation with strong history it seems. It appears the stereotypes of US politics have plagued their way into my favorite shows. The scenes of well known protester chants and slanders against one particular party are evident. I have to admit it could be worse, but I was hoping this series did not jump on the BAND WAGON every media pocket is following. Rick and Morty in the past has proven to be very creative, out of the box thinkers challenging benchmarks of TV and animation. As a long time fan, it is a shame to see them fall into what seems to be the easiest inspiration to plagiarize, political parodies.Aside from that, the adventures surrounding the death crystals was an interesting and fun idea that was delightful to watch, with the exception of the inserts referenced above. My expectations for the remaining 4th season have been greatly lowered however I still look forward to finding out myself if they are better than the season premier.

The writers put a disgusting spin and pulled that right out of -you know. The show says "The Muslim Turks were busy making noise trying to save the moon" and the "Arabs" with Lawrence were victorious during the surprise attack. It seems the show like to say the world Muslim for the Turks because they are losers but not add that for the Arabs although both are are largely Muslim populations. This is particularly painful to me as a Muslim because on the 27 of January 632 a solar eclipse happened in the Arabian desert where the prophet of Islam has just lost his toddler Abraham and everybody was sad for his death, the Arabs were saying even the sun is sad for the loss of Abraham but the prophet corrected them by saying " The sun and the moon are signs among the signs of God they don''t eclipse because of the death or life of anyone but when an eclipse happens pray to God".

I''ve been an avid watcher of the Peaky Blinders since day one and while this opener wasn''t as good as the others, it still was a very good and strong episode.
Has it changed? Yes. Is it understandable that some people don''t like the change in cinematography? Absolutely. But compared to all the other shows out there, it''s still well above average.
The acting and dialogue were good, although a bit wooden at times. The cinematography is different, but also very refreshing.
On the downside: Too much time was wasted on finding the best camera angles and shots which left the story behind. Since the very beginning, Peaky Blinders has lived from the strong and fast forward moving plot. The plot was there, but as others have already pointed out, the pace was too slow for a six episode season.I don''t mind the new art style from the new director, as long as the plot stays as strong as it was during the last 4 seasons.
Hopefully the next episode will have a better balance between the two.Nonetheless a very strong episode.8/10', '5 October 2019');

Today first episode of Dexter''s final 8th season has premiered. And I should say, I did not expect such an amazing start.A Beautiful Day takes us after 6 months period after LaGuerta''s death. Dexter seems to live the same life, he used to. Actually better. He''s become better father, spending a lot time with Harrison, playing football with him and taking son to a beach. But Debra is gone. She is no longer part of his, or anybody''s life. She''s moved to another police department and leads a case on drug sales. However, she desperately runs from her brother, thinking that she shot wrong person that night.Dexter deals with everyday quite successfully. He investigates a very interesting case of serial killer, which amuses him a lot. But then there comes a destruction, someone who might know his secret?This episode gives a fresh look to Morgan''s character - how he blames himself for what happened to Debra and feels responsibility to take care of sister. Dead father Harry, who always kept giving stupid advises, after death at least, pushes him to let Debra go. And he does not, of course.Here is another problem our favorite serial killer faces - he can''t control emotions anymore. And this is huge problem, which can lead him to huge mistakes.I enjoyed this episode pretty much for number of reasons. First, I''ve missed all these very much and it has refreshed my memories of the past 7 seasons. Second, it puts Dexter into multiple troubles, which seems engaging and very intrigue. Third, character of Dexter Morgan becomes more complex. I am sure he will have to make a lot of moral decisions in the final season, if he wants to survive. Fourth, Harrison comes back to fathers life, finally. I think he will be one of the major troubles in Dex''s life and it''s not gonna be easy. Here is my guess (and this is NOT a spoiler): Harrison can be just like his father. Will Dexter cope with that?Finally, this is the best season premiere so far.

First I''d like to point out how all the atmosphere and stories seems off in this episode and characters acting out of their personalities. Nancy sleeps on at Jonathan''s to the morning? Mike and El spend all day kissing in a room? Why did chief Hopper, a decisive and formidable person, not just kick Mike out of his house but instead gets jealous, desperately comes to Joy for help, and tries to lure Mike out in such a pitiful way?Shows usually fail with big time jumps from one season to another. And in this case, season 3 did a pretty bad job with it. The show has a huge emphasis on Eleven''s evolution and how she grows up, yet in season 3, I have no idea how she went from a young girl who just started exploring the world around her to kissing boys all day in a few months. Dustin went to summer camp and has a girlfriend. And apparently there is a mall now.About the plot: Another secret government project brewing and Will is not done with the Upside Down, yes, again. It looks like as if the producers ended the show in season 2 and kinda forgot they have 5 seasons so they have to reboot the show for season 3.

I want a Sherlock that is full of clever observations, quick wittedness and genius-level edginess - the first two seasons did this well. However, since the third season, Sherlock seems intent on trying to be funny to satisfy the hardcode fans - resulting in moments that take you out of the story and make it feel like an artificial self-aggrandising theatre experience. And instead of a fiendishly clever Sherlock, we get a man who states the blindingly obvious, and very rarely observes anything truly interesting.To do Sherlock any intellectual justice requires clever scriptwriting, and this is anything but that. Too often, the story and plot twists are explained to the viewer as if to think them an idiot. And Moffat and Gatiss (the scriptwriters) often throw in over-complicated verbosity in an attempt to cover up for the fact the script lacks real substance, and most of all heart and soul. It feels empty and contrived.By all means, watch this episode if you''re a Sherlock fan, it will give you some enjoyment. But it will also give you the feeling that you are waiting for something good and clever to happen, a feeling that is never satisfied.', '2 January 2016');

Someone that is not funny.The first series of Blackadder was decent and sporadically funny. It was also very expensive with a lot of location shooting.So it was a bit of surprise for a second series to be shown three years later. Ben Elton was drafted in as co-writer along with Richard Curtis. According to Elton, then controller of BBC1 only gave the go ahead with two changes. The budget was to be cut down severely and he wanted more jokes.In a sense this was a very economical series with more laughs per pound. It was also the first sit com made by alternative comedians to receive widespread praise and high viewing figures.The first episode sets the tone of this new Blackadder. Rowan Atkinson''s character is more wisely cynical, cunning and full of put downs. I think it was the first time Atkinson saw himself as a romantic hero rather than a gawky person.The story is simple. Kate is so impoverished that her father wants her to become a prostitute. She goes to London and disguises herself as a boy called Bob to make a fortune.Quick as a flash Baldrick is out on the streets as Bob becomes Blackadder''s new manservant.

If you were to only watch this one episode, everything is packaged up so tightly that it could easily be a stand-alone short film.Plot/Story: 2
An easy score to give, simply because the source material is so robust. They really did a great job of opening with Jared Harris (Legasov), which immediately paints the picture that the events at Chernobyl were more than meets the eye. Flashback to the events that took place involving the reactor, we really begin the story from the eyes of the scientists inside of the station. There is an immediate rush and a sense of urgency from all who stand inside, and there is amazing banter back and forth between a few. Following this was a very brief look into the personal lives of one of the firefighters. It wasn''t forced, nor was there lot of heavy-handed dialogue. There was no need for this, and the writers did an excellent job of saying a little to say a lot, which is rare nowadays. The tension was almost palpable, as we scroll through all of the dilemmas that the scientists, state workers, and firefighters faced, which brings me to the characters and acting.Characters/Acting Skill: 2
I''ve already mentioned Jared Harris, who is almost always brilliant, so HBO kind of cheated on getting him on board. You can tell that all of the people involved in this event could sense that there was something ominous, and they did so with their EYES, not their MOUTHS. Sometimes subtlety goes a long way and you do not need someone to come right out and state their intentions. Even the delirious Paul Ritter (Dyatlov), was nothing short of exceptional. Dyatlov was very fascinating, and I was not too familiar with Paul Ritter prior to the show. What I took away from this first episode''s performance was that he was in a state of shock, mixed with a great fear that caused him to damn the workers, responders, and residents of Chernobyl in the process. Just Ritter''s acting alone was so unique and interesting, but the rest all did a wonderful job.Cinematography/Directing: 2
There is no question the level of competency in this project. If this first episode is a clue, then the rest of the series should clean house with great visuals and set design. The pace of this first episode was immaculate. There was perfect balance to dialogue and chaos that will grip you from the beginning and will not let go until the end. Speaking of the end, wow! Have you ever seen a disaster movie, such as 2012, or some crap like that? Well, Chernobyl delivers style without making you want to throw up from the unrealistic visuals. As the radiological smoke cloud hovers high in the clouds and begins to slowly creep into town, you begin to see the trees turn brown. The very last visual we see is a bird that falls from the sky and slams into the concrete below, gasping for breath and convulsing from the pain (no doubt caused by the bird''s internal organs sludging from the inside). If that does not send chills down your spine, you may need to check and see if you''re a replicant.Sound: 2
No surprise here, the sound was a perfect complement to the well-scripted, well-directed, and well-edited episode. I would include the full name of the composer, but it is rather difficult, so please check the full cast and crew to get the right information. I will certainly be checking out other works by this individual and compare with what was done here on Chernobyl. Moments that were highlighted by tension were superb, but other moments were great as well. The addition of the sounds from each scene coupled nicely with this eeri', '28 May 2019');

Looking for work, she''s been pressed into service as a nanny for a six-year-old boy at a country estate by Mr. Rucastle (Ackland) and his wife. In their first interview, Rucastle takes one look at Hunter and says she''s perfect for the job -- only she must obey some little commands, such as wearing a certain dress and cutting her hair. She demurs but he offers her so much money that, after consulting Holmes, she takes the job.After she leaves 221B Baker Street, Watson asks what Holmes thinks. He seems distracted but then looks up with concern and replies, "I should allow no sister of mine to accept such a position." For some reason, that brief exchange between Watson and Holmes sticks in the mind. Perhaps it''s that Holmes shows so little concern for the welfare of women in jeopardy in his other cases or maybe it''s just that Jeremy Brett delivers that line so flawlessly, with such expressiveness.Not to get into the plot but the scent of Jane Eyre is faint but still perceptible.The credits say "Introducing Miranda Richardson." Richardson was the daughter of a prominent director, Tony Richardson, and the actress Vanessa Redgrave. She does a splendid job here. She''s wide-eyed and pale. She trembles a little and wears an expression of constant bewilderment that erupts suddenly into one of terror when the situation requires it. She''s very attractive, too, in a not-quite conventional way. She seems to need succor and reassurance. A normal man would want to sit her on his knee and advise her to be more confident, while, as Mephistopheles advises Faust, he puts his arm around her waist to feel how tightly she was corseted.We can''t NOT mention Joss Ackland''s incarnation of Mr. Rucastle. Ackland is a tall, robust fellow with flabby jowls that seem to wobble when he speaks. He''s ruddy faced and completely unforgettable, strutting around, gesticulating wildly as he tells Richardson funny stories in order to induce her to laugh. She chuckles with amusement but that''s nothing compared to his bellowing with laughter at his own stories. "He''s killing him," as they say.The story itself isn''t one of the best. It''s not slow, and it''s not uninteresting. It lacks some of the zest and color of the better tales.

The students knew about slavery and Frederick Douglass, of course, and some knew more than is given in the film. But my intention was mainly to establish the context in which the conflict over slavery took place. I''m not sure how much of it sank in. I taught the same course in a state university a year later, when this film was first being shown on TV, in which most of the students were considered elite because they were majoring in difficult subjects. Of the two dozen students, none had watched any of the episodes.Too many American college students are virtually ahistorical. A survey, a few years ago, revealed that no more than half could place the American Civil War in its proper half century.

It''s a work of near genius. I can''t imagine how Ken Burns and his team managed to put together this material in a way that carries so much impact. It quietly and effectively covers the political background and the personalities of the participants in the Civil War. And it carries it all off without pandering. Both sides are well represented. And I don''t know how anyone can hear the letter of Sullivan Ballou to his wife Sarah without being moved by it. Ballou was a nobody, just a soldier. And the prose seems stilted with the passage of time. But its lyricism and vernacular poetry have rarely been bettered. Sullivan was prescient; he was killed five days later. The utter misery of the years to come is hinted at.The written narration, the quotes chosen, are unimpeachable, as is their reading by various celebrities and actors. And between still photographs and period paintings, there are modern scenes of battlefields, rivers, and small towns that evoke the 1860s and are splendidly composed.

This was surely one of the most delightful TV series to watch- to the eye, to the ear, and to the spirit. The superb acting, the sumptuous sets, the absolute perfection to detail, was wondrous to behold. Even the music was first-rate, an oft-overlooked part of any great production. But as Shakespeare was wont to say, "The play''s the thing," and without the incredible writing skills of Julian Fellowes, DA could have easily been just another soap opera, with an English accent. You could say that Fellowes brought a sense of class and gentility to a genre mired in the worst of all possible worlds. That said, although I would have liked to have given the final episode a solid "10," alas, he decided-unadvisedly in my opinion-to give everyone a happy Hollywood ending, and while satisfying to the heart, not exactly within the realm of believability. Not to be overly harsh, I think if he would have left at least a few of the relationships to the imagination, instead of everyone winning the prince, the ending of this television masterpiece would have resonated more strongly in its finale.

Masterfully directed by co-creator David Lynch, I consider this episode to be an unofficial feature film from Lynch, as it is comparable to other Lynch films in both length and quality. Co-written by Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost, the screenplay is credited to Mark Frost, and it is hilarious, touching, and bizarre. This episode is dark at times, but there is a ton of comedy to be found. Mark Frost is at his quirkiest, and David Lynch captures it well. The classic score by Angelo Badalamenti compliments everything. "Twin Peaks", as strange as it can be, has a balance between the horror and the comedy. It is unnerving and effective.(spoilers) With so many cliffhangers from season one to tend to, there is no shortage of valuable information in this episode. Some questions are immediately resolved. However, being the opening episode of a brand new season, there are far more unanswered questions. Even more, new problems arise. There are more cryptic clues to remember in a viewer''s quest for the killer. And, there are more characters added in.Although it may seem slow at first, episode 8 is certainly one of the series'' finest, based on the direction by the multiple Academy Award-nominee alone. But Mark Frost''s screenplay is exceptional, as well. There are some really good moments, including revelations by "Big Ed" Hurley, the return of Agent Rosenfield, Cooper''s struggling recovery, and Cooper''s continuing discoveries.The following episode (episode nine, "Coma") is also directed by David Lynch, and I find that the two go together nicely.

If you think about it, though, if it weren''t for Stephen E. Ambrose writing the book that would eventually become the series, we wouldn''t have this series to watch.Not only did they do a phenomenal job creating this series but the casting of each of the characters was perfect. David Schwimmer as Herbert M. Sobel was great. After seeing Scwimmer as Ross Gellar for 10 years on Friends as the older brother of Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox) who was a nice guy, sort of bumbling, it was a nice change to see him be an asshole.The best part of this series is that at the beginning, or end as in the case of the last episode, the men the characters of this series are based off of are presented to the audience. Not until the final episode, however, does the audience know who each man is, but getting to see these men in later life is a remarkable addition to the series. Afterall, why shouldn''t they be a part of the series that tell the story of their experiences in WWII.Currahee is the first episode of The Band of Brothers series. The episode starts out with Easy Company waiting to head to France from England to begin their part of Operation D-Day. In this episode we meet the many different characters, well most of them anyway. The audience learns that Currahee is the mountain that Easy Company, part of the 506th Infantry, trained. Currahee is also the motto by which these men follow, a Cherokee word meaning "stand alone".So as it has become customary for me to describe my favorite scenes I will do so now.The first scene I liked is when Sobel has Easy Company run up Currahee after eating spaghetti for lunch. Many of the soldiers throw up along the way, but they continue to run up Currahee. As they do so, and the fact that none of his men fall out, Sobel realizes that they are running up Currahee to spite him.The different training scenes are my second favorite scenes. The two best scenes are those that depict Sobel screwing up. The first scene is when the company is in textbook position for an ambush, Lt. Winters (Damian Lewis) pints out this fact and suggests staying in position, Sobel ignores the suggestion and has the company move out... right into an ambush. The second scene depicting Sobel''s incompetence is when he, and some of his men, are on maneuvers and he becomes lost. It is the way he is spurred into action that is the best part. Not too long after this scene is when several of the non-commissioned officers of Easy Company attempt "mutiny" by refusing to follow Sobel into combat.The last scene I like is when Joe Toye (Kirk Acevedo) lists off all the equipment that he has to carry. "Three day supply of K-rations, chocolate bars, Charms candy, powdered coffee, sugar, matches, compass, bayonet, entrenching tool, ammunition, gas mask, musette bag with ammo, my weapon, my .45, canteen, two cartons of smokes, Hawkins mine, two grenades, smoke grenade, Gammon grenade, TNT, THIS bullshit, and a pair of nasty skivvies!" I like the fact that he is complaining about how much he is carrying, but either forgets of doesn''t care that everyone else has the same or similar amount of equipment.I give this episode 9 stars out of 10.

I don''t get people complaining about every episode and every new season, that it''s not "Black Mirror" anymore, that it all went downhill and so on. In the other seasons there were good and bad episodes. I don''t like S01E01, so what? Some people liked episodes, that I think are stupid and a waste of time. But now people just like to complain. If you look this show just to get a shocking ending or plot twist, then maybe you''re watching it for the wrong reasons. A plot twist alone won''t make something bad turn to something great, but an interesting idea as a whole will make you think. And in this episode the idea is pretty damn good. It''s a question everyone has asked himself- where do we draw the line? Where is the border between being honest and a liar, a good person or a bad one, a cheater or whatever? Is our body the one thing that defines us in this life or is it our spirit? What would we do, if we had access to such a virtual reality as shown in this episode? Would you still be a moral 100% straight person loyal to your principles or would you just try everything out, because you''re curious and it''s only a game? In the end, the things most people would want to do in secret would be violence and sex, because it''s in our nature. Did you ever have dreams similar to what happened in this episode? Where you were someone else and interacted in your dream with someone you know, but that person also looked different. Maybe you had awkward sex in you dreams with who knows whom? And maybe it was good in the dream, but when you woke up, you felt ashamed. So why is that? I think that all people are nasty and dirty from the inside, we all have our turn ons and fantasies, that we won''t even confess to ourselves and especially not to others. So when we see someone else doing it, we have to judge it and hate it, because accepting it would mean that we''ve been wrong, our world view is wrong and our morals are questionable. People disliking this episode is similar to hetero guys not wanting to ever see one single gay movie, because that would probably make them gay or something. But lesbian stuff is ok, that''s cool. Just this episode takes it a little bit further and confuses you- so it makes even more people uncomfortable, including some gays. I also don''t get people saying things like- this is unrealistic, this would never happen? If these guys were gay, this wouldn''t happen..if they are straight, they wouldn''t behave like that, and so on. How would you know? Did you experience everything in life, that is possible to experience? Maybe we know that cats hunt down birds, but there were also some cases of a cat adopting young ducklings.

To answer the question; where can we go with these characters? Gatiss, Moffet and co have come up with the answer; down the same old avenues but this time in clown shoes. Every character except the title character have become ridiculous caricatures of their former selves. How many times must ubber-earnest Dr. Watson profess his man-love through misty eyes and missed breaths? How often must Mycroft deny his man-love and brotherly concern? How did anyone think giving Mycroft Holmes the Kranks treatment or giving Molly Hooper a bad case of pantomime transvestitism was anything short of a death knell for a show which is very much rudderless in high seas? The best thing that ever happened in this series was the again pantomime baddie Moriarty shutting his own gaping face hole with a bullet.

"Look he just survived the Reichenbach Fall..deal with it." This is not cute or an inside joke, and has shown nothing but incompetence from the writers. Anyone can write a protagonist onto a ledge, miracling them down again is the price you pay. Cheats! Looking at Gatiss''s credentials based on cooky spooky comedy, and seeing now that he has nowhere further to go with these characters except up in flames, he should do himself and everybody else a favor and stop. He makes fiction for teens and his ideas are restricted by his life''s work. Just as he could not convincingly resurrect Sherlock in series three he has already, with a sad admission coped out of his promise at the end of the same season to resurrect his over-camp version of Moriarty. Very obviously to all that the writers had not the first clue how to do either and whats worse weren''t going to try.

The show then proceeds to introduce the series protagonist, a brilliant neurosurgeon from Japan, now living and working in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, named Kenzo Tenma, but before the credits, you will be treated to yet another sorrow filled sight. He seems to have the perfect life; a beautiful fiancÃ© named Eva (the daughter of the hospital''s director), a great job (apparently with enough skill to one day be head of the surgical department), and the ability to really help people in need. However, when he operates on a famous person instead of the man he who came in first, on his future father-in-law''s orders, and the poor person dies, he becomes emotionally scarred, and disillusioned with the political and power hungry ways of his colleagues; so when he soon after finds himself in the same situation, when a small boy with a gunshot to the head is brought in before a powerful politician, he opts to do what he thinks is the right thing. The basic foundations of many of the main characters are laid down well in this episode, and it should be commended for the way it explains the reasons for Tenma''s first main action, but there are far too many overly emotive pieces in this episode, none of which are truly believable (such as Eva''s chat with Tenma in the cafÃ© or her father''s description of why he became a doctor, both blatant attempts to vilify them beyond humanity) and Tenma has far too many flashbacks for my personal liking (unfortunately a recurring trait of the show). There is also an overuse of dramatic techniques (slow motion and tense music for a woman cutting her steak in a restaurant? Repetition of a woman''s cries, which blend together into one?) and a misuse of the admittedly excellent musical score (an action packed score for a man driving to work?). Much of this episode is left a mystery, and it has a good cliff-hanger ending, making you wonder what will happen to Tenma. The episode is a good beginning, due to it''s introduction of the major characters and it''s way of drawing the audience into it''s plot, though when I see the quality of the later episodes, I can but wonder why this was not of better quality.', '28 January 2007');

So I end up saying things like ''that thing that chased that thing in that place over there''. I''ve yet to complete Planet Earth. I''ve seen bits and pieces here and there, and a few whole episodes, but haven''t sat down to watch the series in its entirety. Still, I was thrilled to hear the series would return on Sunday 06/11/16. As is the case with most documentaries with Attenborough involved, Planet Earth II''s first episode was nothing short of breath-taking. Entitled ''Islands'', it treats us to some amazing landscape and establishing shots. Some of the runtime is also used to present how lava naturally forms new land. Seeing the volcanic matter spew out of the ground in ultra HD is something to see. 10 minutes or so are dedicated to a specific group of animals or a single animal in an area in the world, showcasing a slice of his or her life. Each of these segments brings something brilliant to the table. There are a number of great ones, one of which involves a swimming sloth, another showing the hardship of the life of penguins in taking care of their young, and an amusing one involving a type of bird who spends days waiting for his girlfriend to arrive on a date so they can get jiggy with it. The penguin story takes up a lot of the show''s runtime and it''s definitely worth it. Just seeing all those animals, thousands of them, all in the same frame is just incredible. By far the best segment is the one involving a group of baby iguanas who have just hatched. They raise their heads above the ground and make their way towards the rest of the groups towards the coast. However, between here and there lies a treacherous landscape, hiding an enemy. As one iguana makes its way across the grains, in the same shot a rapid ''racer'' snake creepily follows it. Then another. And another. And tens of more. And you can see where they get the name ''racer'' from, as those things can really shift. The first iguana makes it, but now the snakes are ready for the rest. The entire scene is incredibly tense. It''s like a Hollywood chase scene. Actually, scratch that, it''s better. Some of the shots they managed to pull off were mesmerising. It''s awesome how they managed to form a coherent story from the images which in turn complements just how great the footage was in the first place. Seeing the iguanas run for their lives as the snakes give chase keeps you on the edge of your seat better than half the films that Hollywood churns out nowadays do. Some of the iguanas don''t make it of course and it was a welcome surprise to see the usual kid-friendly BBC nature documentary not afraid to show a bit of blood and guts. If I had to nit-pick about something, I''d pick the music. Though at times the swelling of the trumpets formed a harmonious unity with the images, a lot of the time it had that horrible droning sound you get from a lot of movies in recent years.

Its success arguably paved the way for the network''s future successes, with expensive productions like Rome and Game of Thrones proving worthy of investment. Band of Brothers showcased that, given the right amount of money and talent, anything could happen on television. The possibilities were suddenly endless. This mindset put into a motion a stunning improvement regarding attention to detail from networks, especially those on basic cable, who decided that showing audiences serious drama over programs written with half the effort merely because the television medium had not effectively championed film, was in fact necessary to launch the industry into a new age of quality storytelling that it so desperately needed.Modern television evolved from five shows: Twin Peaks in 1990, which began the water cooler effect (for those unfamiliar with the term, it refers to employees at a workplace gathering around the office water cooler to discuss the shocking developments of the previous night''s episode, accompanied with story predictions and personal opinions); The Sopranos in 1999, which gave audiences and, more importantly, networks, a sense of what television could be if taken seriously; Band of Brothers in 2001, which visualized the budget and ambition needed to progress the medium into a deeper sense of reality rather than possibilities; Lost in 2004, which solidified the format of a serialized drama quite like no other series before it, perhaps maybe other than Twin Peaks; and, finally, Mad Men in 2007. Mad Men used Lost''s serialized nature on a more personal level. That led to AMC greenlighting Breaking Bad. As everyone knows, Vince Gilligan''s engrossing series about an overqualified high school chemistry teacher entering the drug trade kicked off the "current" wave of television program: the "New Golden Age."It''s impossible to discuss Band of Brothers'' premiere episode without first discussing the crucial facts surrounding the medium''s recent history. Without this show, television would be a very different place. Therefore, after nearly two decades, Band of Brothers has remained highly regarded among film and television enthusiasts. It had a whopping budget of $125 million for a single season, with each episode costing approximately $12.5 million, and because it had two great minds behind it, there was little that could go wrong; even if the series did flop, which was unlikely, it would be a lesson learned for television, much like the grave warning of executive interference brought forth in the second season of the aforementioned Twin Peaks.So, is "Currahee" a remarkable episode? This is probably the most basic chapter of the series, which is saying a lot, given how close one feels to the characters shown here for a mere hour. David Schwimmer plays Captain Hebert Sobel to perfection. He is a tough individual, for sure, but is slightly challenged when placed outside of his controlled environment. Nevertheless, as evidenced in the opening minutes of "Currahee," the company benefited tremendously from his hardline policies and strict personality: without Sobel, the company would be unprepared to jump for D-Day. As the episode progresses, it becomes evident that this is what Sobel had been preparing the company for, but the growing resistance to his methods also proved that he wasn''t a capable leader in every regard, as he had little admiration, and hardly any sincere respect.David Schwimmer isn''t alone in his acting chops. We also receive fine performances from Damian Lewis, who plays the main character of the series, Richard "Dick" Winters, and from Ron Livingston, who plays his best friend and frequent confidant, Captain Lewis Nixon. The cinematography of "Currahee" is something to behold as well, especially when it comes to what television has offered as the status quo in the past. The musical score is brilliant as well. With those things in mind, the closing shots of this episode will send goosebumps tingling down the spine, so be prepared.So, while "Currahee" isn''t some grand spectacle, it is certainly a great way to kick things off. It has several excellent moments of character development. The interactions between Winters and S', '21 April 2018');

It''s not the same Twin Peaks as the old one. It''s more obtuse, weirder and a significant portion of it isn''t set at Twin Peaks. And it doesn''t have much in the way of a soundtrack, at least so far. Yet there is something of the spirit of Twin Peaks in it. This is Lynch when not held back by network TV. Part 1 introduces a whole lot of new characters, locations and questions, questions which knowing Lynch will only be partly answered by the end or not answered at all. And that''s fine. This is something that you have to let wash over you, and when you do, there''s a lot of wonder to be found.Lynch has a way of making even mundane things intriguing. We''re introduced to a guy in New York City whose job is watching a box. The slow way Lynch shows his routine could have been boring, but it''s actually kind of absorbing. There''s something about the dialogue and interactions between this worker and the girl who likes him that is just ''off'' enough to be reminiscent of the awkward dialogue you''d find in the original Twin Peaks. But slowly, tension builds, culminating in a rather strangely shot sex scene and a pretty intense, horrific moment that reminds us you never know what to expect with Lynch.Lynch''s way of making common conversations bizarre is at its best with the lady who phones the police because of a bad smell coming from a hotel room. This plot in itself is another one set away from Twin Peaks, so I wonder how it''ll be connected. The crime scene is very gory and further than I''d expected to see in this R-rated vision of Twin Peaks. The arrest of Macklay and his questioning are beautifully strange. His wife seems more concerned about how it will affect dinner with some guests than whether he might end up in jail, and Macklay seems confused about what he did. His confusion during the questioning is well acted and his realisation that he has some time unaccounted for. It seems he didn''t remember what he had done until that moment, after which he was hiding something. So what made him kill Ruth Davenport and then forget about it? Something that has to do with Twin Peaks, I''ll bet.We get some weirdness in the Twin Peaks area too, where someone who looks like Cooper but clearly isn''t gets up to some very strange business. I don''t even know how to describe this scene because I don''t know what''s going on in it, but it involves him staring at some... strange people. Not that''s he''s not strange himself.There''s plenty else to like too, including the return of memorable characters from Twin Peaks, notably Ben Horn, Adam, Lucy and the Log Lady (with another mysterious message, of course). From this first episode it''s already obvious that this season is even weirder, even more experimental, and possibly even more frustrating than the first two.

Right off the bat we get a crazy, absurd moment when an old waiter sees nothing strange about Cooper lying on the floor bleeding (and Cooper doesn''t seem to see anything strange about the old waiter). It''s a bizarre moment that let me know straight away this episode was going to go much further into the surreal than any of Season 1. And oh, it does. Because once the old waiter has left the room a strange apparition appears to tell Cooper three things.This is followed up by yet another fantastically creepy scene in which Audrey has to hide her face from her own father to avoid an incredibly awkward moment. And if all of that isn''t weird enough already, in an at first normal scene at the Palmer''s house Leland emerges with white hair, so overjoyed that he bursts into song. Leland''s signing is so eerie because this is a guy who''s consistently been absolutely miserable, yet now he is the happiest man alive. And yet, his hair has gone white during the transformation. It''s a wonderfully surreal situation. Then Maddy sees a creepy stain on the carpet.

Bobby''s tender moments with Shelly and with his father are enough to make me like him again, even after what he did to James by putting cocaine in his engine.Okay, there are a couple of things I''m not crazy about. The first is when Andy hits himself with a plank and stumbles around. It''s something that just feels outdated, like it belonged in an old Laurel and Hardy skit. And then there''s the ending. While I like the surreal turn this episode took, I''m not sure about this new character Bob. It''s a shocking reveal the way he brutally murders Laura, however the way he acts, especially that roar, is exaggerated, like the villain of one of the bad classic Whos, out of place in a show like Twin Peaks.Those are two minor things.

The script is playful and thoughtfully written. But it was the acting that really stood out.

There are disappointments out there, both as book adaptations and on their own terms (the latter of which for me has always been a fairer way to judge), but many masterpieces.Elizabeth Gaskell''s ''North & South'' is a masterpiece and a beautiful and affecting love story. This four-part mini-series succeeds not only as an adaptation and very faithful but also on its own terms. The story here is still the beautiful, affecting and timeless story that made me love the book in the first place. And the dialogue is wonderfully written, every bit as eloquent, sophisticated and literate as that in the book, as well as insightful. This is apparent from the get go of the first part.On its own terms, ''North & South'' succeeds amazingly. This first part is setting things up, but does so with a lot happening without being over-stuffed. The pace is spot on with few rushed or draggy spots and no skimming over of pivotal scenes, and the length is just right. Plenty of time to flesh out the central relationship and explore with complexity the many different relationships ''North & South'' has. Production-values-wise, ''North & South'' is flawless. The scenery is breathtaking without being too clean, the costumes are beautifully tailored and the photography is suitably elegant. The music is equally very good, with enough elegant and haunting motifs/themes to make it memorable.The direction is always very assured, and the acting is pretty much outstanding with the characters written so well you do care for them and their situations. Daniela Denby-Ashe is a very poignant Margaret, and there are outstanding supporting turns from Tim Piggott-Smith and Lesley Manville. Sinead Cusack is a standout in the supporting cast, relishing her beastly character. What made the mini-series for me was the superlative performance of Richard Amitage, who is very handsome and charismatic, has great delivery of his lines and manages to convey all sides of his complex character brilliantly.All in all, stunning. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '10 September 2018');

He is such a great presenter (in his 90s and still sounds, and looks on a side note, great) and whenever a new series of his is aired they are often among the best the BBC has done in years.Am a great fan of a lot of Attenborough''s work and BBC''s nature documentaries with his involvement are among their best work in years. Have been watching the BBC less over time, but there are always exceptions, unexpected gems and expected treasures that come our way every now and again and their nature documentaries are the perfect examples of expected treasures. ''Life'' is a crowning achievement for a documentary series and actually, like the best documentary shows, feels much more than that. As far as Attenborough''s work goes too, ''Life'' to me is one of his biggest achievements."Challenges of Life" is a wonderful beginning and is testament to why ''Life'' deserves its acclaim. It may explore the challenges of survival for animals, but for the viewer watching it''s an awe-inspiring delight from start to finish.First and foremost, "Challenges of Life" is exceptionally well-made. Hardly surprising, one comes to expect that from Attenborough''s work. In fact saying that doesn''t do the production values justice. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The editing is always succinct and smooth and the scenery and various habitats are remarkably diverse and look speechlessly spectacular.On a documentary level, "Challenges of Life" continually fascinates and illuminates, while there are some familiar facts here a lot of it was very much new. By the end of the series for me more was gotten out of it, and educated me much more than, anything taught when studying Geography and Science in secondary school. Attenborough''s narration helps quite significantly too, he clearly knows his stuff and knows what to say and how to say it. He delivers it with his usual richness, soft-spoken enthusiasm and sincerity, never talking down to the viewer and keeping them riveted and wanting to know more.The wildlife and life-forms are both adorable and dangerous, the wide-ranging diversity of what was included was staggering and it was lovely to see a mix of the familiar and the not-so-familiar. How they adapt to their environments, why they behave the way they do, how nature works and how what the wildlife and life-forms do affects their environments were all touched upon and made their points subtly, not hammering it home too much (a potential danger with documentaries).The cheetah, Ibex, octopus and flying fish sequences, in an episode that covers a lot and is filled with wondrous scenes of great power and emotion, are particularly striking. Not once does "Challenges of Life" feel like an episodic stringing of scenes like it easily could have been. Instead it feels like its own story and journey, with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several. One really cares for what they''re told and the wildlife.In conclusion, wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '4 January 2018');

And no, while Kevin Spacey''s/Frank Underwood''s absence leaves a massive hole, and the show now feels really under-nourished without him, there are many other problems too and every bit as large. For me, and quite a few others it seems, it is a contender for the worst final season for any show.Everything that made the season so disappointing is here right from the start in its first episode "Chapter 66". An episode that amplifies what started to go wrong in Season 5 and makes even more glaring problems along the way. With quality this weak, one can be completely forgiven if they think that this is not ''House of Cards'' but instead a different show entirely already, because that is exactly what "Chapter 66" and the whole of Season 6 for that matter came over like."Chapter 66" has a few things not done too badly. The photography is slick at least, it was only in the season''s last two episodes where this aspect didn''t impress all that much. The music has its moments, having presence without being overbearing (though generally it could have been more subtle, later episodes did this worse though).Michael Kelly brings his usual intensity and pathos to Doug, even if the character was more interesting and better used in the previous seasons.On the other hand, Claire is no longer a particularly compelling or well-written character. She was great as a co-lead and pitted against such a meaty character like Frank, but she lacks gravitas and is out of her depth and lost on her own. There is no fire or nuance here now, here and throughout Season 6 she is a one-dimensional wannabe-Machiavellian incapable of making logical decisions. Robin Wright''s acting also suffers, now a blank and as charismatic as wood and she plays the character too coldly.Performances-wise, only Kelly''s is above average. Everybody else in the case looks uncomfortable and disconnected as simplistically written and vaguely underdeveloped characters (to the point of parody). A prime example being Greg Kinnear. The writing is now terrible and one of the main reasons as to why ''House of Cards'' felt like a different show in Season 6. With an overload of stale and cheesy one-liners, over-used cliches and seat-squirming-inducing banal dialogue that induces unintentional laughter at times. There is little really going on in the story, which basically just crawls along. When there is anything that happens, it feels forced and unrealistic as well as not leading to much.In summation, weak start to a majorly disappointing season and a weak episode of ''House of Cards'' and anything for that matter. 3/10', '3 August 2020');

Although there is the odd great show such as ''Young Justice'', ''Regular Show'' and ''Adventure Time'' there are also abominations such as ''Johnny Test'' and ''Uncle Grandpa'' (which sadly are two of the shows most often aired).And then here comes the 10-part mini-series ''Over the Garden Wall'', and while it''s not one of Cartoon Network''s all-time greatest it is a gem of a show. One of their best in a long time and in a completely different league to what aired now. "Chapter 1: The Old Grist Mill" is a terrific start, that establishes what is so good about ''Over the Garden Wall'' beautifully. That it is not the best episode and that the show got even better is a testament to ''Over the Garden Wall''s'' greatness. There will be some reiteration here and in my future reviews of the other episodes of that for the show, because all the episodes have exactly the same qualities. For one thing, "Chapter 1: The Old Grist Wall" is really beautifully animated, with the handsome and very smoothly detailed backgrounds coming off particularly strongly and the mystery of The Unknown setting is realised brilliantly. Think ''Adventure Time'' but with more detail, darkness, sweetness and colour. As well as being good-looking animation, what the animation also does so brilliantly is two things, one being that it sets the melancholic but sweet folksy atmosphere of the stories very effectively and maintains that quality consistently and the other being how well it transports one to another world completely and draws one into the world to utter transfixing effect.It is very charmingly and hauntingly scored, having a real presence while also allowing the atmosphere to speak, which it wouldn''t have done as effectively if the scoring was louder, brasher and more constant. "Chapter 1: The Old Grist Mill" definitely benefitted from having a more melancholic, lilting and sometimes sparse approach to the music. The main theme is very memorable too.The unique story is paced perfectly, feeling swift but never rushed and gentle while never dragging, and are very imaginatively and compellingly told even when episodic in nature. It is better than anything airing on the network at the moment and rivals (or comes close) its best work too. Like with the animation, the atmosphere is melancholic, quirky and folksy, these qualities coming over in a gentle and very touching way and never getting silly or confusing.Writing is also hugely successful. It''s funny, suspenseful and remarkably poignant, but it''s not just that these qualities are present; it''s also how they''re balanced and written that made the writing strong. The humour never felt juvenile or too much, in fact especially with Greg some of the writing is adorable and at its best hilarious, the numerous emotional moments which can be primarily found in the characterisation of Wirt don''t make the mistake of dragging things down. It really succeeds in allowing one to relate to Wirt and his troubles and the suspense is nail-biting but should not unsettle younger viewers too much. All this without one of them over-powering the other, this easily could have had too much humour of the wrong kind jarring with the atmosphere or been too scary, neither the case here.Here in "Chapter 1: The Old Grist Mill", the characters are very well written, looking like and having the personalities of folk fairy tale figures. The protagonists are very easy to relate to, especially Wirt and it is easy to be endeared by the resourcefulness and cute optimism of Greg. The voice acting is strong, Elijah Wood''s Wirt is very deeply felt and Colin Dean''s chirpy enthusiasm contrasts most endearingly. Christopher Lloyd is also great as the memorable character of the Woodsman. Overall, a wonderful start to a gem of a series that got even better. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '24 March 2018');

Its first episode "Islands" couldn''t have been a more ideal start, meeting and exceeding incredibly high expectations. This may be reiterating what has been said many times about Attenborough''s work, but pretty much everything he''s done, even those that are not quite masterpiece status, has consistently the same strengths so it''s unavoidable. Throughout it''s an awe-inspiring, utterly transfixing experience where one forgets they''re watching a documentary and instead feeling like they''re watching art, that couldn''t be higher praise for anything."Islands" for starters looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and island habitat are simply spectacular, the rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normally bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter moments, Hans Zimmer''s music here is a remarkably good fit. It''s unmistakably Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances them. The main theme is impossible to forget.What of the narrative aspects? Can''t fault "Islands" in this aspect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise. In short, it''s just fascinating, informative and thoughtful.Nothing but credit is due too for adhering to what made ''Planet Earth'' work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nice ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers all this information beautifully in a way only he can achieve, there''s a soft-spoken enthusiasm, sincerity and precision about his delivery and he never preaches while knowing what to say and how and when to say it.The animals are a mix of cute and menacing. Love the iguanas and they are clearly "Islands" biggest highlights of an episode with a great many.Like Attenborough''s best work, "Islands" and ''Planet Earth II'' in general feels like its own individual story and never feels episodic or repetitive.

It leaves me in complete and utter awe every time, with how much is learnt about all the different seas and marine inhabitants and how it all looks visually. It is also one of his most ground-breaking, in that it''s the first comprehensive series of oceanic natural history and including and exploring creatures and their behaviour that had never been seen before. As said in my reviews for the individual episodes of ''Frozen Planet'', it is a shame that despite being one of IMDb''s highest rated shows, the ratings here for each episode individually has such a wide divide between them and that for the show overall. To me, the series overall is wholly deserving of its acclaim and the individual episodes are rated far too low."Ocean World" is as perfect a first episode of a nature documentary as one can get. It was the recipient of two awards for its cinematography and music score, and both are richly deserved. Everything about it is truly wondrous.

Instead, it feels like its own individual story with real, complex emotions and conflicts. One roots for the animals, whether prey or predator, like they were human characters, one actually wants the grey whale calf/killer whales scene to have a happy outcome.In short, wondrous. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '29 November 2017');

So many loose ends, so many questions left unanswered, and yet, the 2 hour premiere only proved to pose more questions that I''m sure we won''t get answers for quite some time. The first part was filled with long takes of trippy Lynchian visuals and new faces. Without any real trailers or marketing material, this episode was very hard to follow. Not that I thought anything Lynch did would be easy to understand, but this was particularly incomprehensible. We began with Cooper in the black lodge, same place we left him at the end of the series'' original run in 1991. Yes, it seems Laura Palmer was right in saying we would see her again 25 years later. With a welcomed brief appearance from the giant, the opening set the stage for what we were about to see. And I think what we saw is fascinating, because every single shot feels like David Lynch''s true vision for this show. There''s no way Showtime interfered at all. Both episodes felt like something straight out of Lynch''s entire body of work. Without the second episode, it''s hard to really dive into the specifics of what the premiere entailed. 2 people in New York City were seemingly murdered by a white blob, the log lady notified Hawk of something strange related to Cooper, and more murders in South Dakota where a Cooper Doppelganger seems to be linked to.

Still I was disappointed because the things that made Westworld so good in the beginning are all gone.First of all, I felt like the acting was off in this episode, although that could just be because I wasn''t entirely caught by the plot anyway. This brings me to my second point, which is the plot itself. I see that they''re setting up multiple lines for this season and it could actually go somewhere, but nothing in this episode has been gripping. Dolores'' quest comes with little challenges as she''s overpowered, Bernard might be going somewhere but he wasn''t relevant here at all and the meeting with the board just didn''t come across. In addition we waste about 15-20 minutes of this episode on the introduction of a character that so far isn''t too compelling or relevant. This is all especially bad since some of the most interesting characters of the show are given no screen time at all (MIB doesn''t show up and Maeve is only seen post-credit). I know things will make more sense later but for a season opener two years after a disappointing season finale you''d expect more.Then there is another issue which has to do with culture. Westworld has always shown a great interest in foreign cultures, especially by including the new parks in season 2. However, this episode seemed like classic US/western propaganda as it presents a world some decades in the future in which American cities are supermodern but a harbour in Palawan still looks the same as it does now. Meanwhile, it''s unrealistic and slightly ignorant to hear a character say "is this the girl you met in Burma" when said country has been renamed to Myanmar decades ago when these characters were definitely below high school age.I know this season might actually go somewhere interesting and I get that some episodes are needed to set up the rest of the plot, but for a show that was great for its complex storylines, acting and focus on even minor details this episode was just sloppy and underwhelming.', '21 March 2020');

I understand that, against Dave''s wishes, Comedy Central is airing the scraps of material that he had shot before his exodus. Are such actions dishonorable on the part of Comedy Central? That''s for you to decide. Politics, business, and preconceived notions aside, this new episode is hilarious.I''ll admit it: I found it very strange that Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings were hosting the show. Their presence, although unsettling at first, became acceptable and even welcome by the show''s conclusion. If the hosting torch had to be passed to anyone, I''m glad it was them. Hosting aside, the show was spot-on.The genius of Chappelle''s Show is that Dave''s comedic style on the show has evolved as Dave Chappelle the man has evolved as a person. Dave does not pretend that he is still a "street" comedian. On this new episode, he accepts the fact that he is now a celebrity. He has accepted it, and he''s ready to move on. By acknowledging his celebrity status - nay, celebrating it - he has voided any discomfort on the part of the viewer. We''re on the same page with him, ready to progress forward.For me the highlight of the show had to have been the "Revenge" segment. With each successive person he crossed off the list, the revenge he exacted became more and more extreme until it reached a bloody climax with the murder of a former, wheelchair bound comedy club owner.Equally funny was the Tupac segment. Not only did Chappelle make the observation that the music industry has picked Tupac''s legacy apart by scrounging up his old recordings and inserting them into new, pre-fab songs, but he''s also making a tongue-in-cheek statement that maybe Tupac isn''t dead. All of which done in the unique, laid-back style of Chappelle. I also found it quite ironic that the segment would be about a corporate entity cannibalizing the material of an artist who is no longer producing material, when essentially Comedy Central is doing the same thing to Dave Chappelle.Overall, I''d say these "new" episodes maintain most of the magic of the original two seasons.

But I think many people are going to dislike it, particularly given the immense hype surrounding the new series.Most of the episode seems totally unconnected to Twin Peaks. It takes place in other locations following other characters. Periodically, every ten minutes or so, scenes with Twin Peaks characters are sprinkled in. I enjoyed both these aspects of the episode on their own. The rare moments of Twin Peaks provided by the episode were very nostalgic and on point tonally. And the rest of it was very well executed generic David Lynch stuff. It''s just... the two did not gel well together. The show is called Twin Peaks, and so those scenes in the town with the old characters are what we are expecting to see. By consequence, the other stuff feels like a jarring commercial break that we are waiting through so we can get back to the good stuff, despite the fact that it is good in its own right. On top of this, the transitions between the classic Twin Peaks stuff and the new stuff were not at all smooth.As a result, I found this first part to be a somewhat unsatisfying experience.

They are taken into custody and Data takes their communicators and Geordi''s visor. They then start speculating how Lore may have persuaded Data to turn on his colleagues. It is determined that he gave Data negative emotions and somehow disabled his ethical subroutinesÂ to ''cure'' him they will have to find a way to restart these subroutines. Meanwhile the Borg ship returns and Riker orders Dr. Crusher to beam up as many of the away teams as possible then return to Federation space via the sub-space conduit. She returns to the conduit but doesn''t enter; instead she sends a message buoy before returning to beam up more people. The Borg ship attacks and she orders the navigator to take the Enterprise into the sun using the shield modifications that were first introduced in the episode ''Suspicions''. Riker and Worf meet a familiar Borg, who has not been seduced by Lore''s ideas, and attempt to rescue Picard and the others.This episode provides an exciting conclusion to a two part story and a great start to season Seven. The big question at the end of the last episode was ''how could the ever-reliable Data turn on his friends?'' and here we learn just how Lore engineered it for him to be given certain negative emotions before over-riding his ethical subroutines. Having Data acting out of character and his ''evil'' brother Lore appear in the episode gives Brent Spiner chance to be a little less restrained which is a lot of fun to watch. This episode also sees Gates McFadden take her character into a more interesting direction as Dr Crusher is left in charge of the ship and has to make decisions that could have life or death implications for all on board rather than just one patient. The story is exciting with plenty of tense moments; most notable as Data performs potentially fatal experiments on Geordi. It was nice to see how this story referred back to events in previous episodes. Overall a great start to the seventh of final season of TNG.', '27 August 2015');

That is only the beginning of the weirdness; he is then visited by a very tall man who gives him advice about the investigation. Once he has been patched up at the hospital the investigation continues and we learn more details about the night before; Leo and Nadine are in comas, Pete Martell is suffering from mild smoke inhalation and Catherine and Josie are missing. Since Leo had been shot at home they set about searching the property and Andy accidentally discovers a quantity of cocaine. It is also established that there was a third man present the night that Laura Palmer was killed and he was the one who actually killed her; of course with Jacques Renault dead and Leo in a coma it may take some time for the police to identify him... we will have to wait longer to discover who did kill Laura Palmer.This was a great opening to the series; writer/director David Lynch did a fantastic job keeping the various story lines going without any of them getting boring. The opening scene should get viewers hooked again; the unconcerned old man was surreal enough then the tall man took the strangeness to another level. The strangeness continues when we next see Leland Palmer; his hair has suddenly turned white which understandably shocks his family. As before much of the fun of this series is derived from its slightly strange characters; it is great to see FBI forensics expert Albert back; once again he is rubbing everybody up the wrong way; Miguel Ferrer is great in this role; Harry Goaz once again provides some laughs as Deputy Andy Brennan and Kyle MacLachlan continues to excel as protagonist Agent Cooper.

He hires them to steal an unspecified cargo from a train and makes it clear that failure to deliver will have serious consequences. The caper doesn''t go quite according to plan because there is a squad of Alliance troops on board the train, they get the cargo of the train but Jayne ends up with a bullet in his leg and Mal and Zoe are left on the train. When they get to the next stop they are interviewed by the local sheriff and are disturbed to learn that they have stolen vital medical supplies. Back on Serenity Jayne wants to take the cargo to Niska''s men but the others disagree and when Simon gives him a pain killer for his wound he gives a large enough dosage to knock Jayne out. After Inara has rescued Mal and Zoe they do the right thing even though it leads to a confrontation with Niska''s men.While slightly less dark then the original pilot this episode was a lot of fun and introduces the characters in a way that doesn''t seem like a rehash of how it was done previously. We are clearly shown that while our heroes are quite happy to operate outside the law they won''t do so at the expense of those even worse off than themselves.

The audacity of his scheming mind, the easy banter when he spoke directly to the audience and constantly pushing himself against mounting odds was the glue that kept the series together. I did feel Robin Wright was perfect as the thinking woman, playing along with her husband but burning with ambition. But once you take Spacey out of the equation, she did not have the gravitas to keep the series together nor the depth to make any of the absurd situations convincing. The whole series crumbles under the brilliance of the previous five and this remains just a shadow, watched by fans wanting to find closure.It was also not going to be easy for the writers to find a new narrative. So, instead, they narrowed the world, making it one woman''s ambition Vs the desire to control of the Shepard''s. The other players flinted in and out, some walking in with hackneyed lines and absurd sub-plots which remained poor attempts to reach scale.

I try my best to make things as clear as possible and i hope it is working out fine. If not, please forgive me. So, where do i start...As an X-Files Fan from the very first hour i was of course looking forward to see the new Season but did not had any high expectations due to the slightly disapointing Season 10. Especially the mythology episodes, those i actually liked the most from Season 1-9 disapointed me, because they kinda felt rushed a bit and due to that they lost the myth of the ologie. Unfortunatly, after watching the first episode of S11, i cant even say that i was disapointed... i was simply angry how bad this ep. was. I even felt betrayed. Okay, so what was wrong with that episode;Lets start with the CSM. Probably my favourite Character of the whole series. I loved him so much, because he was so mysterious. In the past, he used to be very rare, even within the episodes, but when he joined the screen, u knew that stuff is getting real. U knew that something is going to happen, even if it was just in ur mind messing things up. The "New" CSM is boring. He is not rare at all, actually i think he had most of the screentime. He completly lost all of its remaining myth in a single episode. In my opinion his character was simply burned. Next... when u thought, Season 10 felt rushed, u have not seen Ep1 S11. I dont wanna spoil it for you guys, so i dont go into details but what i have to say is, that this whole episode felt completly overloaded. Actually thats an understatement. This episode contains more different myth paths then Season 1-6 combined, but due to this rushed overload of scenarios, the whole episode contains actually nothing. Its just a prieview of what might happen later on, but it actually Spoils the whole Season. The point of the old X-Files was, that u had no idea whats coming next. This wont be the case in S11 and further on obviously. Another negative thing about this episode was its "ungloomyness". Its about as spooky as Gilmore Girls and barley darker / mysterious then a random How i met your mother episode.

Already we are revisiting "I, Borg" and "Brothers" and in this finale, also season 6''s "Suspicions".Picard, Geordi and Troi are captured by Lore and Data - Data is NOT himself. His Ethical Subprogram, the one thing that makes him different than Lore, has been shut off. Crosus (Brian Cousins) shut it off in the last episode. In fact Crosus is Lore''s number one Crony. Meanwhile, away teams are out on the surface, and Worf and Riker while trying to track Picard''s whereabouts, find Hugh''s secret lair- So we see that Hugh may have been the catalyst for this new state of Borg Individuality, but he did not exploit it - That in fact was Lore.But "Captain Crusher" is on command of the Bridge - And is attacked by the huge Borg Monstrosity-Ship while the away teams are planet-side.With about a minute to beam everyone up, they get all but about "47" crew-members who are on the planet before she is chased off by the huge Borg Non-Cube ship - She traverses the Trans-Warp Conduit and sends out a beacon, then goes back to try to get those 47 crewmen.And this is where we meet Ensign Taitt (the gorgeous Alex Datcher) - Low Ensign on the Totem Pole, Crusher keeps her handy on the Bridge and this is good for her, and us as well. James Horan, who was the evil Jo''Bril in "Suspicions" shows up as "Lieutenant Barnaby" - And this is a mix for some great Bridge Interaction.Down below, Data begins to torture Geordi, who had seen with his VISOR that Lore is in fact controlling him. Lore orders Data to take the VISOR away. Riker and Worf confront Hugh - Hugh gives us the history behind this change in the Borg, but he will not help Riker and he still blames The Enterprise and crew for what had happened to them. But he does show Riker how to get into the main complex.Meanwhile Crusher goes back to the planet, on the opposite side of where the Borg "Winchester Mystery House in Space" is, and is able to beam up all but Riker and Worf and Picard''s party - So, with nowhere to run heads for the SUN. Because she has a plan.She uses the Metaphasic Shielding tech left over from "Suspicions" to enter the stars Corona, and stays there, while the Borg ship waits.Picard with Geordi''s help is able to reboot Data''s Ethical Subroutine, it''s a guess when and if it worked. In fact it works right away, while Riker, Worf and Hugh (who had changed his mind) get into the main Borg- Palais.Ensign Taitt has a way to get the Sun to Flare Up - As Worf''s brother Kurn had done with his warp drive in Redemption Part II - And is seen again in Deep Space Nine, Season 7, Episode 2, Worf uses the same technique to blow up some Jem''Hadar Shipyards. This is also where Ensign Taitt and Lt Barnaby have some great discussions.Despite this treatment of The Borg, many of the other aspects of this episode were central for some of the best episodes of Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. And the Data/Lore storyline is finally given an ending. We are left with the impression, despite all he had done, Lore really did finally have love for Data. Data still cannot share this, but Lore had the emotion chip - And Data will not have it until "Generations". And my favourite part of this episode is as Lore is deactivated, his eyes cloud over and we can see the life going away.So we see here that Lore, not having Data on hand to share the emotion chip with, was using it to influence The Borg, who were at least halfway "artificial" - It also explains why Lore had sent Crosus to get Data. Lore was trying to make The Borg as totally electronic as he was, we saw the destroyed Borg Drones he had experimented on.And I think, this is a hard story to swallow, not because of the native change in the Borg, not that the Borg had been destroyed - We know from this episode that the rest of the Borg Collective had not been affected by Hugh. Some of this was explored in Voyager. But the juggling of Data/Lore/Borg and Metaphasic Shielding, perhaps was too much stuff for the average fan to digest. But as I revisit these two episodes, the more I enjoy them, the more connections I find in them. And I always loved the Lore episodes, where Brent Spiner plays against himself.My Only Regret is that "Hugh" - Jonathan Del''Arco - Did not have a reunion with Geordi, there was simply no ', '24 May 2013');

The segment with the hatchling iguanas and racer snakes is, as others have mentioned, truly wonderous - an action movie chase made all the more better by being entirely real. The variety of animals we see is vast, and we learn a little bit about each one of them, about the trials and tribulations they go through in their life. Really, other than the confusing (poorly edited?) komodo dragon segment, the video side of things is awesome.For me the flaw in the series lies in the narration. In this epidode, it''s not as bad as it is in some of the other ones, but still you get bits like "...and these (islands) provide life with an opportunity to experiment... and evolve" (...Are there places where life doesn''t experiment or evolve? Isn''t that life''s whole thing?) or "Island life encourages to do things differently. And on some islands, this is essential" (Sorry, David, but this sounds more like you''re in love with your own voice than you actually making any kind of point).', '6 April 2020');

No, not really, they''re fairly standard, and Murray''s one is quite impressive vocally. Is it because of unfunny jokes? Yes. Because of illogical plotlines (Seriously, since when a rich, Western musician would have a problem fending off or settling a lawsuit from a former-Eastern-bloc act? J-Lo and Pitbull were never even bothered about stealing from Edward Maya or the original Azerbaijani author for one of their tunes. And there''s no in-universe way "Crazy Dogggz" could''ve plagiarised the clip and the song both, as the bongo guy had the song before he met the "keytar" guy)? Yes, also. Because of a weaksauce reversion to the mean when bravely changing the status quo probably would''ve improved the story (by creating a "FotC"-"Crazy Dogggz" rivalry; having Murray deal with newfound appreciation and money etc)? Mainly because of that actually, yes. Yes. Right then.', '30 August 2020');

I was really hoping that Greg Daniels and the creators of the office learned from last season''s mistakes, but they didn''t. I watch old episodes of the office on almost a daily basis which always leave me in a roar of laughter or at least happiness, but this episode just made me sad and pulled me out of the story line. The actors who play Jim and Dwight just weren''t acting that well at all, and I was never interested in the story. I didn''t laugh once. Andy was a huge jerk for no reason and I didn''t understand why the writers chose to give him the characteristics that made people hate Will Ferrell''s character of Deangelo Vickers.And Kevin was just clichÃ© in his stupidity.I look back to the earlier seasons of the office and become deeply saddened.None of the characters are the characters I fell in love with. Jim is now basic, not a prankster. Pam is a little mean and boring, not cute, perky, and moral. Andy is now a jerky boss, not an annoying singing sales man with anger bursts. Angela is now a happy normal character, not a tightly wound strict Christian girl who got angry and offended over everything.I miss the pranks and love hate relationship between Jim and Dwight; now they seem to enjoy their company. I miss the older cameras that made each episode feel like a reel documentary and brought the set in a realistic light, not a modern, commercial one. And most of all, I miss Michael Scott. The episode only had one miniature highlight at the end, but overall the episode wasn''t funny and was disappointing. I will still finish the season though.', '20 September 2012');

CGI and special effects I suppose are offered in it''s place. Hopper & Winona Ryder''s characters relationship devolves into bickering at each other 100% of the time, the kids are outsmarting and outmanuevering assassins with relative ease, the monster scenes are not tense or frightening on any level.I remember very much looking forward to season 2, even season 3; tbph I can''t say whether I''ll watch season 4 or not, at all- that''s how bad season 3 was imho. At best it''s now a show for preteens of the Disney variety, lacking any compelling substantive draw with cringe worthy bad humor and a boring story filled with characters now a caricature of their former selves.', '19 February 2020');

We meet Kate, disguising herself as a boy called Bob, who becomes the object of Edmund''s affections much to his disgust. We''re swiftly taken to the court of the Queen Elizabeth I and her Nurse Bernard and trusted friend, Edmund''s rival, Melchett. Returning is Percy from series 1, with very little change in his character. He''s the only thing from series 1 to remain the same, which is just as well. Blackadder is much cleverer and less of the blundering fool. Baldrick is an idiot. Suddenly all is well.The filming is all done in sets now and that''s how Blackadder will always be from now on which is no bad thing. Ben Elton is a welcome addition - He''s the one who revamped the look and feel of a struggling show and it''s just as well that he did, too.The episode is based upon Edmund''s inner strife as he realises he''s falling for a man which is frowned upon in Elizabethan society. Eventually he learns of Bob''s true identity and the two plan to wed. It''s here that the true highlight of the episode comes when we meet the fan-favourite Lord Flashheart (Rik Mayall) who shows up, makes woofing sounds, says too many innuendos to count and then steals the bride - And the show.Blackadder II is often regarded as the first series to truly capture the spirit of what this show should be and it gets off to a cracking start. While the plot is not realised to quite its full potential the series has definitely become a cultural icon now and so it shall remain for the rest of its run - And beyond!

BA1 saw him striving for the throne of England. BA2 saw our hero aiming to keep up his good reputation with the queen. BA3 saw him stuck with two idiots where all he could do was hope to occasionally get hold of some cash. Here, all he wants to do is survive. The result is a much darker set of six episodes and arguably the most divisive of all the four series.Personally, I love "Blackadder Goes Forth". Its dark satire about the most horrible period of human history is brilliant and it gets off to a cracking start with an episode about the horrors of life in the trenches. In the first scene the joke is about having the bullet with your name on it so as not to get shot by it and that sets the tone for what''s to follow.This is an episode that sees Baldrick''s awful cooking (a joke revisited in "Blackadder Back & Forth") as a joke at the start but the episode eventually comes full circle and uses it as the solution to all Edmund''s problems. The plot sees Edmund lie about being a good painter (stealing George''s work as his own in an extremely funny moment: Permission to speak really quite urgently sir otherwise I might just burst!) and loving ''King & Country'' (Soft, strong and thoroughly absorbent. I knew it would be right up your ally!). In doing so he proves that he should be taken out from the trenches immediately. It''s a joke that will be reused in "Major Star" about Charlie Chaplin, but that time and this have the setup lead to different situations so we can excuse it.The other greatest bits of this episode is the normal procedure for standing on a mine, the introduction of Darling (that''s Captain Darling to you) and the cooking instructions for Rat Au Van. Good start to the series, but the next episode completely outdoes it in every way. Shame that the food jokes are so juvenile and silly really.', '3 December 2014');

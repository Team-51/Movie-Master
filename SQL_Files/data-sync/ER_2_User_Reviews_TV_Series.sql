Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, "The Wire" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting.

Little else shows such skill and dedication from its makers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger than ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and to this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effects. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far - for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnecessarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far, and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely wonderful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the largest, best quality screen you can find.

The results are genuinely sublime, with an astonishing range of natural wonders captured by photography that is surely peerless in its beauty, range and consistency.

I have been watching a series of TV marathons, and started to grow tired of the situation comedies which are there for humour and the serious dramas where everything is so dark and real. I wanted an adventure that is fun and I don''t have to see all of the dark, realistic moments. This show was perfect for that. It brought out my inner child with its silly, fun and happy nature, yet still had an exciting, well rounded and intense story. It hit almost every mark.I disagree with people who say that if you dislike the first season, you''ll dislike the rest. No, this series does change. I actually didn''t really like the first season. It was too childish and relied on childish humour too much. The characters felt rather two dimensional and the story didn''t appeal to me. But as the series progresses, the characters have turning points. You don''t know when they change, but you can see that they''re growing up. I didn''t even know Aang (voiced by Zach Tyler) had changed until the last episode, where I realised that he had gradually became grown up and was no longer a naive child.You do gradually find yourself getting attached to the characters. They begin to feel three dimensional, which is a sign of a brilliant show. I even grew feelings for and felt sorry for who I assumed would be the main antagonist of the show. Zuko (voiced by Dante Basco) gradually gets his own back story. He''s in his confusing hormonal year, sixteen. He can''t tell right from wrong and is becoming his own person. Throughout the series, we see him gradually evolve until he makes a big change in the final season.Not only this, but for once I straight away warmed to a newly introduced character. ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is certainly great with new additions. Toph (voiced by Jessie Flower) quickly became my favourite character due to how bad-ass and adorable she is in her own way. So ''Avatar'' certainly succeeds with its characters, which is what I mainly look for in a show. Each character undergoes changes, which also changes the show from being extremely childish and rather boring to more of an intense, family show.Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have both created an amazing, well rounded show. Not just these two deserve credit, though, as I believe each of the crew did an amazing job. Many writers and directors have contributed. It has a somewhat Japanese feel too it. I believe the writing in the show is Japanese, as well as parts of certain beliefs and lifestyles. It also looks very much like an anime. It''s sort of like an American, children''s anime. The Japanese influence is definitely noticeable.Quite possibly the best thing about the series is how well-rounded it is. There''s a sense of accomplishment when you reach the end. The entire journey that the characters must undertake is explained at the beginning, and that journey is what happened throughout the show. We had the structure of the entire series right from the beginning, and that''s what we got. We waited patiently, watching Aang on a long adventure with his friends, Katara (voiced by Mae Whitman), Sokka (voiced by Jack De Sena), Appa (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) and Toph, until the huge, climactic finale which ended everything satisfyingly.So, as you can tell from my review, this is a brilliant series. Rounding my votes up (adding the ratings together and dividing them by the number of episodes), I got an average of 7.9/10. That''s mainly due to the series being rather slow, in a way. It''s well-rounded, but not all of the episodes are great. I would still give the series an 8/10, though, because I wasn''t satisfied with the first season. The reason it got a 9/10 is because it is a children''s show. I would have loved all of it as a child. So it isn''t perfect, but it''s better than an 8/10.This series brought out the inner child of me. It was fun, and adventurous and reminded me to enjoy certain things which I have forgotten about. I even began to find certain bits of child humour funny, such as Sokka''s jokes at times. It deserves the attention is gets as it should fully satisfy both children and adult alike. Technically, I''m still a child, but I''m close enough to an adult to enjoy the stuff adults do. This series got everything right, and I enjoyed it more and more as it progressed.

The boys lose their mother to illness, and they try to use alchemy to bring her back. This goes horribly wrong because they neglected the basic rule of alchemy, the principal of equal exchange. To gain something from alchemy you must give something of equal value. The brothers'' disastrous experiment costs Edward his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Ed manages to affix Al''s soul to a suit of armour, at the cost of his right arm and the two maimed boys are left alone to study alchemy in the hope of restoring themselves to normality.A little while later a colonel in the military, another alchemist named Roy Mustang, invites the brothers to become State Alchemists, an offer only Edward accepts, giving them access to the enormous resources of the military that brothers hope will help them to recover their lost body parts. The brothers set off in search of the Philosopher''s Stone as a means to restore their bodies. Throughout their journey, they meet allies and enemies and discover the true nature of the Philosopher''s Stone, and an awful secret plan that they must fight to prevent.Review: FMAB contains that wonderful thing, a totally original, self-consistent universe different from ours, but familiar enough not to be off-putting. The characters are all distinct, fully-formed and convincing; you will love most, hate a few and not care much one way or the other about others. The story is brilliant. It begins in a relatively small way with the brothers travails, and expands into something magnificent I will not go into.It''s mood is finely judged. There''s some light comedy, some tragedy, a lot of action and something to think about, and all the while the character development is gripping. The relationships between the characters are complex and changing, and the brothers grow up during the series, adding more levels. There are those wonderful moments when you see one of the enemy attacking the wrong person and you think "That was a mistake", because the relationships are clearly enough defined that you know retribution is on its way. A lovely example is Roy Mustang, the Flame Alchemist, explaining to a homunculus that has just attacked his ''dearest subordinate'' how he uses one hand for macro effects like burning an entire room and the other for pinpoint attacks, like evaporating the fluid in the hapless homunculus'' eyeballs. It is the minute attention to detail, all detail, that makes this anime so special.The graphics are excellent. I really like them for both technical quality and art. I have recently seen ''better'', but that was because the goalposts moved, and techniques improved. FMAB still has 10/10 graphics.I recommend watching in Japanese with subtitles. It''s just better. The American voice actors did a good job, but it''s just more characterful with Japanese voices. The voice acting is truly excellent; it''s taken very seriously in Japan, and they do it very well.As I said in the title, I think that this is probably the greatest animated entertainment ever made. If you only ever watch one anime make it this one. If you watch anime anyway and haven''t seen FMAB, do so. It would be a complete waste of your life if you were hit by a meteorite before you saw it. When was the last time you saw a cartoon 25 hours long and couldn''t stop watching, despite the fact that life would be somehow empty after it was over? Do yourself a favour, buy this.

As an 18 year old who has watched the entire show, and who is eagerly awaiting the next episode, I have to wonder what they are thinking. The show features a diverse array of characters, each with story, issues, and flaws. The development and maturation of the younger characters as they encounter a world in crisis and interact with each other is evident throughout the show and is well executed. The world of Avatar draws heavily from various Asian cultures to create an environment for the story that, if not entirely original, is fully realized and feels like a real place with real history and culture. The effects of elemental bending and spirit entities on the societies of Avatar are well thought-out and serve to distinguish Avatar from other Asian themed shows, giving it a unique feel (it is definitely not Anime). The creators clearly strive for realism, in both the fight scenes and in the world the characters inhabit, though blood, swearing, and graphic deaths are notably absent, since it is supposed to be a kid''s show. For example, The creators consult with a martial arts expert on every episode to precisely determine how bending moves should look, based on selected real styles. Also, All writing is done in Chinese calligraphy by consultation with an expert. The people who make Avatar have managed to create a story that, while especially suitable for younger people, has elements that resonate with all age groups. Overcoming difficult situations, trusting others and yourself, the necessity of self-discipline and effort, and the value of moderation and balance are central themes in the show. I don''t want to include any spoilers, so suffice it to say that the plot is compelling as well. I should also mention that the show is frequently hilarious. There is frequent use of humor, but it rarely detracts from other aspects of the show, and generally only adds to the story''s quality.', '8 January 2008');

You''re going to give a show that you supposedly loved 1 star just because you didn''t like the last 4 minutes? God forbid a show actually make you use your brain to get answer instead of spoon-feeding it to everyone. Please do yourself a favor and google "sopranos ending explained" and read the first article, it''s long but you''ll appreciate the show much more. Showing Tony actually getting whacked would have been tasteless, boring, and wouldn''t have left us with anything to talk about. If you really pay attention and look at the fine details everything is there. Plus we had already seen Tony get shot on several occasions, and the fact that people spent 6 seasons cheering the guy on and then want to see the series end with him bleeding out on the table in front of his whole family. Some things are better left to the imagination, and when you put all the pieces together it''s really pretty amazing what David Chase pulled off.For anyone that thinks Tony''s fate is up for debate, it''s not. Some people say that it just meant that he was going to be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life (wrong). For starters, the finale opens with a shot of Tony asleep in bed and is supposed to resemble him dead in a coffin (and there is churchy sounding organ music playing). Then one of the few flashbacks in the episode is Bobby telling Tony "you probably don''t even hear it when it happens." Those are just a few hints out of many.More importantly, the entire final scene was set up from Tony''s point of view. It opens with him walking into the diner, they show him, they show the table where he will be sitting, then they cut back to Tony, and then there is a jump cut back to him sitting at the table. It''s a strange looking cut, but it makes it appear that Tony is looking at himself (like an out of body experience).During the final scene, you hear the bell ring 4 or 5 times, each time it cuts to Tony''s face, then shows the doorway to the restaurant, and then cuts back for Tony''s reaction. They use the bell to create a Pavlov''s dog type effect, it makes you expect to see certain things each time the bell rings (shot of tony looking up, followed by a shot of what he sees from his POV). So the last time you hear the bell ring, you see Tony''s face, and based on the established pattern the next thing should be what Tony is seeing (Meadow walking into the restaurant). But instead there is a smash cut to black, why? Because Tony is dead and you are seeing his point of view, he is no longer seeing or hearing anything. Chase wanted to do 30 seconds of black originally, and if it had just been the end they would have faded out the music instead of stopping it immediately. So You know that he got shot in front of his entire family, Meadow walked in at the last minute and witnessed it too. Carmella and AJ were looking at their menus and wouldn''t have had a chance to warn Tony. And if Meadow hadn''t been late then the shooter wouldn''t have had a clean shot. To me that has much more of an impact than seeing him bleeding all over the table. The guy in the Members Only jacket going to the bathroom to get the gun was a throwback to the Godfather when Michael Corleone went to get the gun from the restaurant bathroom. They show each of them eating one of the onion rings that Tony ordered, which is supposed to symbolize taking communion. Tony had done too much messed up stuff to get off scott-free, and everyone knows that in the mob you either die or go to jail. Whether you understood the ending or not, The Sopranos is one of the best TV series of all-time. It''s a show with so much depth and complexity that you can watch it over and over and still find new stuff every time. If you only watch a few episodes here and there and then just watch the finale, you''ll probably be disappointed like all the other idiots that did that were. I mean would you read the first couple chapters of a book and then read the last page and decide that it sucks?', '12 May 2012');

Ward and directed by celebrated documentarians Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, the series cost $30 million to make, and was in production for over ten years, with the ten episodes running to a gargantuan eighteen hours. Assembled from over 24,000 photos and 1,500 hours of archive footage, the show features interviews with 79 people, including analysts, bureaucrats, journalists, artists, anti-war protestors, draft dodgers, conscientious objectors, deserters, Gold Star family members, and American, South Vietnamese, and North Vietnamese troops. Deliberately eschewing interviews with historians and major polarising figures such as Jane Fonda, John Kerry, or Oliver Stone, the series features what Burns and Novick define as a "ground up" approach; concentrating almost exclusively on the experiences of ordinary people and soldiers from every side.Telling the story of a conflict, to quote the film itself, "begun in good faith by decent people, out of fateful misunderstandings, and prolonged because it seemed easier to muddle through than admit that it had been caused by tragic decisions," the show begins in reverse; following a brief introduction, scenes of well-known archival footage literally begin to run backwards. It''s an unusually stylistic opening for a documentary, especially a multi-part documentary on public television, but there is an important conceptual point in this aesthetic decision; reversing such familiar images works as an opening thematic statement - yes, we all know these pictures, we''ve all seen them before, but this series is going to show them to us anew.Beginning with the French invasion of Indochina in 1858 and concluding with the opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982 (although some brief postscript material goes up to President Barak Obama''s visit to Vietnam in 2016), the series hits all the beats you''d expect within this timeframe - the rise of Hô Chí Minh and the formation of the Viet Minh; the Korean War; the Battle of Diên Biên Phu, and subsequent French withdrawal from Indochina; the rise of Lê Duan and the formation of the Viet Cong; Thích Quang Duc''s self-immolation; the Gulf of Tonkin incident; the Têt Offensive; the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam; the Kent State shootings; the Pentagon Papers; the Easter Offensive; the Watergate scandal; Nixon''s resignation; and the Fall/Liberation of Saigon.However, where The Vietnam War excels is not in trying to present an all-inclusive encyclopaedic summary of everything that happened in the war, but in its mixture of the macro and the micro - intercut into the larger framework of political analysis and military assessment are more relatable and personalised interviews, which serve to reinforce what the war was like for the people who actually fought it and their families back home. These human stories serve as Burns and Novick''s "ground up" material, helping to contextualise the wide-ranging and less personal socio-political canvas against which they are set, never allowing the audience to view the conflict as a statistical abstraction or a dry chronological list of battles. Indeed, in relation to this, one of the most immediately and consistently obvious aspects of the series is its respect for the individual combatants on all sides.If the micro is the show''s heart and soul, however, the macro makes up the bulk of its content, and in this sense, perhaps the central-most theme is how the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations each got deeper and deeper into the conflict despite knowing it was a mistake to do so and that the war was either unwinnable, or could only be won with unacceptable losses. Although they continually assured the press and public that things were going well, and the North Vietnamese would soon surrender, behind the scenes all three presidents knew the situation was dire.A major theme throughout the series is the effect the war had on the American psyche.

As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics. Those shows are gone. Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, The Batman, Chowder, Kids Next Door, and more have been dismissed for garbage cartoons like Teen Titans Go! , Adventure Time, Ninjago, and Uncle Grandpa (No comment on those new Pokémon incarnations). With the exception of Clarence and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network is a joke. CN''s lone redeeming factor is Toonami, a late-night segment form Saturday evening to Sunday morning where various anime are featured, and one of them used to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.I never liked Brotherhood; I love it. An avid reader of the FMA manga, I stumbled upon Brotherhood on Toonami and, from there, I was hooked. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime''s protagonist, the famed "Fullmetal Alchemist" whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward''s mediator during Ed''s explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.The majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn''t focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There''s Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There''s Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime''s most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening''s singer. Plotwise, there isn''t a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres.

This series aims to use technology never used for nature programmes before to take us into these wildernesses and see the environment within them and the creatures that live there. Starting with a journey from one pole to the other, this series explores the extreme conditions of mountains (from the birth of one to the coldest of those existing), deserts, caves, oceans, fresh waters and others to present some of the most impressive footage ever seen in a nature documentary.With a budget of about £40 million, the BBC were going to have to deliver something pretty special to avoid the usual accusations of waste tax payer''s money, catering to a small audience etc etc. However with Planet Earth they have easily silenced the critics to present a nature programme that is interesting and education. The biggest selling point is the footage which, at its worst is impressive but at its best is simply breath-taking and actually had me saying "wow" at some points. I am not naturally a nature programme viewer but this show had me hooked from episode 1 where a quick glance at the opening minutes had me staying with it for the following eleven weeks. The footage is impressive and, although it is the weakest part of each hour, I did enjoy some of the "Planet Earth Diary" sections where we actually saw the technology, techniques and sheer trial of getting the views that we get. My words can''t really do it justice but the series gives footage that you won''t have seen anywhere else before  with episode 1 claiming that the footage of a pack of dogs hunting told experts things they hadn''t previously known.However I have seen some a couple of nature documentary feature films recently that have also had impressive footage but Planet Earth backs it up with a typically informative and engaging narration from David Attenborough. For me he added enough educational value to prevent the series just being televisual wallpaper  which of course is what it also does in terms of providing some beautiful material that would work even if the sound broke on your television. Like many others though, I would have liked there to be more connection made to the impact that man''s actions are having on the ecosystems and animals that we are shown  for example are they getting rarer or having their habitats shrinking? Occasionally it does this but nowhere near enough  which is partly why some critics have labelled it "environmental porn", which I can understand but do not totally agree with.Overall this is a great series that does a great job of presenting the beauty of the natural world but just about having enough educational value to it to avoid it just being the television equivalent of wallpaper for your computer.

Also, now that graphics technology is more advanced than it was years ago during the first Cosmos series, the illustrations are much more telling and mesmerizing; this helps the viewer to visually break down some complexities that Neil alludes to in some of his narrative discussion.I can''t think of anyone better to narrate this story other than Neil.

Even forty-five years on, it remains a benchmark both in its account of WWII events and in documentary film making.It would be all too easy to have given something other than a sober, dispassionate account of events; nonetheless they managed to do this quite well, despite the often appalling events being described, and the temptation towards political posturing. From Olivier''s measured delivery, through the script and editing work, the interviews with protagonists and survivors alike, even through to the evocative music and credits, this series is a masterpiece.After the Great War, the war to end all wars, the first fully industrialised war, who could think it possible that the World would be plunged once again into global conflict only twenty years later? Yet it happened; from initial events such as the Japanese invasion of China and German expansionism in Europe, eventually there was war on multiple fronts, with few countries not somehow dragged into the conflict.Instead of presenting events world-wide in chronological order, which would potentially be as confusing as ''the fog of war'' itself, this series breaks the conflict down into twenty-five episodes, each giving an account of one theatre of war or one aspect of it. Some episodes are truly harrowing even now; the passage of time alone cannot dim the horror of those events; interviews with survivors almost invariably betray deep scars that could never fully heal, creating statements which are more powerful than the words alone could ever convey.Of course there are errors and omissions; there is relatively little mention of the fate of the Baltic states, for example. Other facts, such as the existence and importance of the Ultra secret, were not fully publicly disclosed even then, which today puts a different slant on the accounts of several of the battles fought, notably the battle of the Atlantic. As time goes on, doubtless other secrets will be revealed which may yet change our perspective on some of the events; nonetheless this does little to undermine the achievement and importance of this series.A final comment is that when this series was made, the world was arguably still at war; the cold war was at its height and we were (and maybe still are) potentially only a stone''s throw away from nuclear Armageddon.', '23 December 2018');

Much of the wildlife has barely been filmed and some such as the wonderfully agile Wild Amur leopard have probably only been seen by very few living people in the flesh.It is narrated by David Attenborough who has the perfect voice for wildlife documentaries and his presence is almost a guarantee of quality in itself. His record speaks for itself.Some of the sequences shown are very brave, most notably the struggles of the polar bear to find food on the ever-decreasing Arctic ice. Too many nature documentaries succumb to "niceness" and show only cute animals looking sweet. To understand how Man is changing the planet it is crucial to show how wasting energy may be affecting wildlife in distant lands (or seas). Sadly it is also important as it seems all too likely that much of the footage will become museum property in the near future, showing subsequent generations the marvellous diversity of life Earth used to enjoy.Overall it has some good educational value as it can be enjoyed both by young children and was recommended by my tutors during a conservation module of my degree.', '16 January 2007');

Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg''s "Saving Private Ryan" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself. Told over ten gut wrenching episodes, the story centers on a company of soldiers in the 101st American Airborne Division in WWII from their initial basic training to their landing in France on D-Day to their many battles and ordeals through to the liberation of a concentration camp and finally through to the end of the war. The soldiers are ordinary people thrust into horrific situations and shows how each is able (or not able) to deal with the situations. The battle scenes are realistic and convincing and the special effects are breath taking. While the series depicts the trials and tribulations of the company, it isn''t afraid to show how the war affects seemingly sane and rational men. For example there is a scene where the nominal hero of the story, Winters (Damien Lewis) shoots an unarmed German soldier out of frustration. There is also a scene where a group of German prisoners are cut down by an American officer after he had given them cigarettes. Even after the German surrender there are instances of out and out murder of Germans. This is very rare for an American war story. The cast is of largely unknown actors, which makes for a more effective telling of the story. There is no John Wayne leading the troops to victory kind of thing. Damien Lewis is very good as Winters who rises through the ranks to lead the company. Ron Livingston plays his friend and second in command, Nixon. Others include David Schwimmer, excellent as the training officer, Scott Grimes as Malarkey the grizzled sergeant and ex New Boys on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg effective as Corporal Lipton.

It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it''s greatness, it began to flounder in it''s second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it''s very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It''s hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren''t subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details.

The passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. Most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.The information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact.

Humans have advanced far beyond the ''hunter-gatherer'' status which was widespread tens of thousands of years ago, and if aliens made a documentary back then which happened to include humans, then i think it would have focused largely on the way in which we hunt, co-habitate and reproduce. A series devoted solely to humans would of course look more in depth at our primitive technologies, ability to communicate, social aspects etc....but this series has a much broader spectrum to cover - many of the species on the planet today!, so it''s fairly obvious that it should focus on the primary functions of the world''s non-human animals - that of hunting, co-habitating and reproduction!The series lacks in-depth information.

And yet this is not fiction but historic reality. The large hosts of military armies chanting "Sieg Heil" amid the plethora of swastika banners and German crosses appear like scenes from a surrealistic film, almost imaginary in its strangeness. A central figure elevated to the status of messiah by his people, almost a god, fueled by the undying devotion of millions. An horrific ideology overtakes an entire nation which had been known for high culture, literature, science and music. And the crimes against humanity within its borders escalate before this messiah and his nation confront the rest of humankind through a conscious combination of political maneuvering and military might. The messiah is not one of benevolence and peace but one of wrath and war.Is this a nightmare from which humankind would awaken eventually and say thank goodness, it was only a dream? Or a dark landscape of atrocity from which the only escape is death? And yet, no matter how unreal these times appear to us three quarters of a century later, the events of Europe in the 1930''s and the 1940''s have become not just a chapter of human history but a multi-volume work of epic proportions, the modern equivalent of Homer''s "the Iliad" or Edward Gibbons "Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire". World War II is the great epic tragedy of the 20th century, a story written in the blood and anguished cries of millions, and rivaled only by its parent, World War I.Jeremy Isaac''s "The World at War" produced in the late 1960''s and early 1970''s and premiered on British television in 1973 (and later in the US) remains the most outstanding production to date in English which presents a coherent narrative of one of the strangest episodes of human history. Narrated by the incomparable Sir Laurence Olivier, "the World at War" was the first attempt, so far as I know, to piece the large puzzle of people and events, both large and small, into a presentable film. For nearly 23 hours, divided into 26 episodes, audiences are taken back to the early 20th century to witness events that literally changed the course of human experience. The film relies on Olivier''s narration, archival footage from the era, interviews of scholars, and interviews of people from the time, recounting memories of what they had witnessed.The interviews alternate between people of high standing and those of middle class as well as scholarly discourse. In the first episode, one woman remembers being enthralled to the point of silent awe when Hitler and his entourage greeted her and her colleagues. Another woman recalls that the doctor to her children had been dismissed from a hospital he had helped found, only on the grounds of his being of Jewish decent. A scholar recounts how Hitler perpetrated the burning of the Reichstag and blamed it on the communist presence in Germany to strengthen his power by marginalizing rivals. Hitler''s strategy was to gain complete political solidarity in Germany at the price of human rights and freedom. But his aims did not end with Germany; Hitler sought to regain those lands around Germany which had been lost as a result of World War I. The documentary begins with Hitler''s rise to Chancelor of Germany in 1933 as head of the German Socialist Worker''s Party (Nazi Party), and his eventual rise to dictator upon the death of President Hindenburg in 1934. Hitler schemes to destroy all political adversaries to promote complete centralized power of the government. In short, he completely remakes Germany''s political and judiciary structure to encompass an ideology in which political dissenters and those labeled as part of inferior races (i.e. Jews, Gypsies, and other minorities) are not only marginalized and stripped of human rights but are to be persecuted and eventually exterminated. At first, the world seems only to watch in awe and anxiety but for some reason is reluctant to act. The documentary then furthers how Hitler will take his ideology outside his boundaries and force the world to reckon with this new European power. The dictator plans to absorb many of the surrounding countries of western and central Europe into t', '6 January 2011');

The documentary series was produced between 1971 and 1974 by Jeremy Isaacs of Thames Television and featured many key interview subjects, from the common soldier in all the armies to major powerbrokers such as Lord Mountbatten, war correspondent and novelist Lawrence Durrell, Hitler''s architect and Armaments Minister Albert Speer, who disingenuously tries to weasel out of his responsibility for the Nazi genocide, German Admiral Karl Dönitz, Averell Harriman, Alger Hiss, film star James Stewart, who served in the US Army 8th Airforce, and General Eisenhower''s driver, Kay Summersby, and Adolf Hitler''s secretary Traudl Junge. There are even segments with the last survivor of the assassination plot against Hitler, Ewald Heinrich Von Kleist. It is an amazing filmic and journalistic feat that was accomplished, for so many aspects of the war that are missing from other attempts at visually documenting it are here. Isaacs got many honors for the series, from a knighthood to the Royal Television Society''s Desmond Davis Award, L''Ordre National du Mérit, and numerous Emmy Awards. Watching this series, again on DVD, and thinking back on my dad''s removed fascination with it, when originally aired, made me realize that those days with my dad are now farther removed from the present than the war years the series documents were from his watching of them. Yet, I know why he was so rapt by the series, despite its flaws, and the fact that a more thorough and unbiased video history of the war is just begging to be made. It''s because the series wisely focused on the ordinary person, like him. This focus undoes almost all the biases the rest of the series promotes, and makes the whole DVD set an easy recommendation for history buffs, yet to be used as a starting point, not an end all and be all. This series was not just the tales of the giants: Hitler, Churchill, Stalin, Tojo, Roosevelt, Rommel, Mussolini, Eisenhower. It was tales of the ordinary man, and how his contributions changed the world.Watching this series also nails the current lie that we are involved in some global struggle, a ''clash of civilizations'', on par with the World Wars, when we are really avaricious and unaccountable myopics absurdly trying to fend off some puny backwater terrorists. This series shows those claims for what they are- lies. Now is not a time of giants that will be studied in the future for their contributions in moving the world forward, but of small men with small agendas, which is a thing quite different, in the worst possible ways, from being ordinary men, like my dad was; ordinary men who helped change human history for the better, in The World At War.', '21 September 2008');

I think Ken Burns does an epic and moving job covering the events from a big picture political perspective. You really get a sense of the weight of history, and the scale of tragedy, particularly how decisions made by presidents and governments set in motion forces that led to catastrophic suffering. Millions of deaths and unhealed emotional wounds. I also thought the documentary was very good at the military level, describing battles and engagements that I had never heard of, in a reasonable detail. And the music and photography was epic. Seeing those pictures of old-time American life juxtaposed with the chaos of Vietnam was so moving. I also thought the reconciliation part at the end was really beautiful. There were three things about the documentary that I did think were weaknesses.1. There was such a focus on the protests, and starting so early on in the series, it kind of overwhelmed the narrative in some ways. I have read that the vast majority of veterans were proud of their service in Vietnam, and did not have this tortured sense of regret and shame that you see with those interviewed in the series. Some did but not most. (for evidence see this article - https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ken- burnss-vietnam-is-fair-to-the-troops-but-not-the-cause-1507324058)2. I wonder about the conspiratorial angle of things. This documentary portrays the North Vietnamese as almost magically destined to win, as if it was inevitable, as if nothing the Americans could have done would have made any ultimate difference. I just wonder if part of the reason the Americans lost is because they weren''t allowed to win. I mean, had the Americans occupied Hanoi and Haiphong Harbour, would not the North Vietnamese have been unable to prosecute the war? Surely if the Ho Chi Minh trail was permanently occupied in several places there wouldn''t be the communist resupply into South Vietnam? But perhaps none of this would have been possible without China directly entering the conflict. Who knows.3.Because the documentary is so long, and also attempts to cover the bigger historical events, I don''t think it captures the day to day experience of the Vietnamese villagers that well. I mean, what made someone turn to the VietCong? What was daily life like? There is another, Vietnamese documentary "the face of the enemy" which I think does a better job of this.Overall, a fascinating time spent watching this, and I recommend it to all with caveats.', '12 October 2017');

If you don''t believe me, look at the user ratings.It makes me tear up that most of my friends and almost all Americans don''t know what Cosmos is (or what "cosmos" means), yet they can name every Friends cast member and their character''s name and quirks.Computer graphics have come a long way since 1980, and just a few minor scientific updates are needed, but the series was so far ahead of its time that other than the spaceship deck set, the hair, and the clothes, it doesn''t seem dated in 2004. It won the Peabody and Emmy awards, and remains to this day the most watched PBS series of all time (600+ million viewers in 60 countries).The series is 13-hours, but ought to count as a three semester hour (~45 hours of class) Intro to Cosmology college course. Sagan''s ability to communicate the essence of the cosmos and the history of scientific discovery is concise and absorbs the viewer.If ever there was a series that explained "life, the universe and everything" (an appropriate quote from Hitchhiker''s Guide to the Galaxy), Cosmos is it. Cosmos takes the viewer on a journey from the origin of the universe to the end of time and displays it as easily as looking at a calendar on a wall (literally, at least from the origin until present time!). Evolution of all life on Earth is condensed into a simple animation only a few seconds long. A detailed history of the origins and interactions between religion and science is engaging and sure to provoke discourse between viewers. The series also explores the massive capacities of information available in the brain and DNA (virtually wiping aside "nature" in favor of "nurture"). Cosmos details Mars and Venus and uses them to eloquently describe the "greenhouse effect" and its possible repercussions on Earth. I could describe episode by episode, by suffice it to say, it encompasses almost every "big picture" question one could ask.Some people knock Carl Sagan for seeming smug or turning from a researcher to a public entertainer. I think of his entertainment as education to a broader audience, and any smugness should be discounted in favor of the information being conveyed. Sagan did society a tremendous favor by making this series. This is the most digestible science series I''ve ever seen. This should be required viewing for all high school students (or elementary students in their later elementary grades).Whether you buy it, rent it, check it out from the library, or borrow it from a friend, watch this series. Thanks to Cosmos, you will have a better understanding of your universe.(Incidentally, Sagan''s speech is suspiciously similar in style to Agent Smith''s from the Matrix. I''ve never heard of Hugo Weaving crediting Sagan as an inspiration but, intentionally or not, the similarity is there.)', '28 July 2004');

A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, joined the Hitler Youth even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in WAW.This documentary is SO far above the History Channel''s documentaries I also own, that there is no comparison.The ONLY fault, and it is a small one, that I have with WAW is this: the numbers are not included, many times. For instance, if you''re talking about lend-lease, then how much war material was lent/leased? How much to Russia, how much to Britian? How many merchant ships did the U-Boats sink, and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese Navy have, total, in 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies have, in total, and by country? Lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off, but I would have preferred MORE! And naturally, I always want to see more military analysis. Like WHY didn''t Patton & Clark trap the German army that was at Cassini, after they had it surrounded, instead of racing Monty to Rome, and letting it escape?

It won an Emmy and a Peabody Award and was viewed by over half a billion people.Not merely a dry, didactic statement of facts, COSMOS appeals to such a wide audience because Sagan makes every episode, every topic, every nuanced syllable as interesting as possible, using props, special effects, reenactments, shooting on location around the world - the brilliant scientist himself, turtled to the neck, the most interesting prop of all.COSMOS is also an optimistic cry to humanity; an understanding of our place in the universe; a plea that we are all in this together on a small blue rock drifting in an endless ocean of night...It has dated, yes, and the special effects look quaintly chumbly-wumbly (especially the hokey "Spaceship of the Imagination" Sagan supposedly travels the cosmos in), but COSMOS is a perfect example of what the methodology of science is: a continually-changing facility, presenting the facts from evidence gleaned up to that point, but knowing those facts will change with more precise measurements, images, monitoring, researching - and welcoming those changes. No one - not even Sagan himself - would claim this series or his book of the same name was the ultimate be-all and end-all of knowledge (matter of fact, in 2005 The Science Channel rebroadcast COSMOS with updated computer graphics, new satellite photos of our solar system''s planets, and digital sound).

Suffice to say that the two main characters are two Baltimore city detectives. Jimmy McNulty (played by Dominic West) is a white Irish rebellious detective who will screw anyone to get to the criminal he is chasing. Along the way he hurts a lot of his fellow cops, his bosses and lets down his immediate family time and time again. With all his faults though once he gives you that great Irish grin of his all is forgiven, no matter what the circumstances.McNulty''s partner is Detective William Moreland, better known around the station house and the bars simply as "Bunk" who knows McNulty best. Bunk is a heavy set well dressed black cop (played by Wendell Pierce) who likes to chomp on a cigar and drink hard liquor to extremes. Bunk has a lot of life in him, and is considered a cops impression of what a real detective should be. A hard drinking, womanizing, persistent cop who really wants to get the worst criminal elements behind bars serving hard time. Both Bunk and McNulty have ex-wives and two children but their lives really evolve around the city of Baltimore''s urban city corners where drugs are always readily available, and murders are popping up within the walls behind condemned row houses by the dozens. The other two characters who deserve special mention are the drug lords, Avon Barksdale (played by Wood Harris) and Russell "Stringer" Bell (played by Idris Elba). Now these two gangsta''s grew up on the city streets of Baltimore like many other city hoods but the difference is they had both street smarts and the will to kill anyone who got in their way. Theirs are interesting story lines throughout the series and keep the audience guessing what they will do next. No spoiler alert so I will defer from giving away too much on their path to destruction.Two characters who you can''t help but feel compassion for due to their diverse journeys throughout the series are the drug addicted junk man Reginald "Bubbles" Cousins played to perfection by Andre Royo, and the shotgun wielding gay drug thief Omar Little, also played with fearless perfection by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now their lives when involved in any scene are never predictable and you cannot help but root for them to win. Hell, even the cops cut them a lot of slack as they can see that their hearts are big, but their minds are twisted after living on the streets their entire lives.I could go on and provide details on at least another dozen strong performances by other cops, attorneys, judges, police captains, shipyard workers, and even kids, but I suggest instead that you keep this crime themed television series on your "must watch" list and if you ever want to see a series that captivates the drug crime world of a major urban city such as in this Baltimore story you won''t be able to stop watching until you watch at least a couple more episodes before you go to bed far too late in to the early morning hours because it is just that good a dramatic crime series.

But we all had learned to read between the lines and my farther used his military channels to find out EXACTLY what kind of catastrophe was taking place. He had some info from KGB guys themselves. However, he was reassured that Kiev and certain parts of Ukraine was free of the nuclear fallout and the level of the radioactivity was within normal urban level. He was also clearly warned where NOT TO GO under any circumstances: North-West of Ukraine and big part of Belarus was a heavy fall-out zone. They also mentioned some European countries. Needless to say, that nobody else was talking about this on TV. We made a decision not to change our plans for the summer, but keep in mind those warnings.Each of us had DKP-50A - dosimeter that measures the exposure dose of gamma radiation. We checked the data afterwards and all measures were withing normal limits or less. I remember though, that it was restricted to collect mushrooms or wild berries in the forests anywhere in Ukraine. Any dusty environment was considered dangerous. All water wells were sealed with plastic etc etc
Mini series exceeded my expectations. Authors put quite an effort to correctly depict intricate details of this catastrophe.

People, behavior, political relations etc. Example of such a minuscule inaccuracy - officials, let along common folks, didn''t use "comrade" as frequently as it might seems from the episodes. It was very formal, official form of addressing. Usually, after first meeting, they addressed each other by the first AND middle name.

The mesmerizing scenes of birds, soaring in the blue sky, their sleek feathers glimmering in the sun, the captivating green of leaves trembling in wake of monkeys jumping over them, the enchanting scene of Nubian Ibex baby deftly climbing down the cliff, dodging the red fox, the eye relieving sight of flamingos parading in a single line and all the grandeur of mountains superimposed by the stars in the time lapse, specks of ice swaying down in the winter scene and all enrapturing beauties of nature playing out right in front of our eyes, it is all a reminder of how majestic this world is.The trance is culminated by the legendary voice of the gem, Sir. David Attenborough. He is a major part of all this beauty. All this fragile beauty and all the majesty of these creatures invokes a feeling in the viewers mind and heart that this world, nature, animals and human beings living in it are mystically intertwined, connected and linked.

The rivalries between Detroit and Chicago with all our rival teams for so many years being in the same conferences and divisions, you are almost expected to loathe each others'' teams and fans.But even 25 years past it''s still a real thing, whether justified or not, and I will always consider Jordan a suck for forcing Isiah Thomas off the Dream Team. Other people may be taking flak e.g. Magic Johnson now after so long to get some of it off Jordan, but at the time the sole thing stopping Thomas from (rightfully, it was a real unwarranted slap in the face to him) being on the team was Jordan, and everyone knows it.It came close to a real abuse of power, in this case star power to interject himself into a decision he should have had zero influence in. That makes it doubly ironic that he didn''t help his biggest asset, Scottie Pippen, out by using the undeniable star-power franchise-making influence he had over the entire Bulls organization from bottom to top to force the GM and/or owner to offer Pippen a wage reopener on his contract. Other athletes did this all the time to help out a teammate who got a particularly horrible contract, ones with much less power than Jordan I might add. When Pippen was traded Shaq immediately gave up 2 million dollars a year of his own salary to give directly to Pippen, and they were brand new teammates with no existing relationship of any kind.That''s what a classy player does, or one with the slightest lack of pervasive self regard. At the time I''d hoped it shamed Jordan a bit for Shaq to have done what he did without a second''s thought, again, what a class act in comparison, but Jordan has always struck me as an Ayn Rand-type, with that "I at least partially lucked into this lifeboat so I hope the rest of you suckers can swim" attitude, and him never lifting a finger when he could have with absolutely no detriment to himself to make sure one way or another than the league-wide disgrace over the pittance Pippen was paid was rectified. There was no downside to Jordan to help out someone who''s supposed to be not just your most needed teammate to help you do the magic, like Messier to Gretzky, but also a friend.But maybe that really ruthless way of looking at every opportunity or situation on or off the court as toward one single goal, winning, blinded Jordan to this really easy opportunity to do something truly righteous and with the kind of fortune Jordan amassed through sponsorships he could well afford to shave a couple of mil off his Bulls salary to help out Pippen who had arguably earned that money right off Jordan for how they had eyes in the back of their heads knowing every second where the other one was on the court, it was uncanny.And I haven''t even mentioned the series yet I know, but I wanted to give the full context about how many different things I don''t like about Michael Jordan before saying how much I loved this documentary series. I''m a big fan of documentaries, but especially longer series versus a feature-length, where the director and writer(s) can really dig into a subject. I watch the classic older docs like "Victory At Sea" or "The World At War" that Laurence Olivier narrated so well, and I try to watch every decent documentary series from all over the world as much as I can (other than cheesy ones with inaccuracies that don''t dig very deep into the subject matter, like those churned out by "history-themed" cable channels).I came into this wanting it to be a total hatefest on my part while watching, about this documentary was so riveting in that way that it makes you forget yourself as well as any preconceived notions one has about Jordan; maybe that is why this has really proved popular beyond all expectation in this weird time we are in.

That alone is genius and falls along the lines of Pulp Fiction with the way Travolta, Thurman, and Samuel L Jackson were casted, along with Harvey Keitel.But then you get absorbed into this world you never thought you would meet, nor have you ever seen before. You keep waiting for it to become a typical show and for it to "jump the shark", but as the seasons progress, you just never witness or experience that at all.Instead, the show actually takes you to a place that you never saw coming (if you didn''t know spoilers), and it is actually a place of truth. This experience defies twenty or more years of cinema, including the movies.No matter what anyone says, I don''t care, this is possibly the greatest cinematic experience I have witnessed as a whole since the mid-90''s.

Also, the stuff covered is not as amusing to the grown up audience who had the pleasure of enjoying the original. You already know this stuff.However, the qualities Cosmos presented to us in 1980, are still the same. It''s a very inspiring series well suited to kickstart a young mind into independent critical thinking, curiosity and appreciation of science. The pace and presentation have been changed to better suit todays young, and older audience may not appreciate this. The pace is however still comfortably relaxed compared to other TV material aimed towards the same audience, making me think they will have a very similar experience to the own we had all those years ago. But this series is for the young, and I''m sure it has all the qualities the original had needed when it comes to trigger their curiosity, fascination and generally change the way they see themselves and the world they live in. Personally I think Tyson does a great job walking in Sagans footsteps.Adults with much knowledge about our world criticizing the series for being shallow and bring few new details to the original don''t impress me at all.

It''s one third of what I like to call the "holy trinity" of TV dramas, the other two being the much loved Breaking Bad and the critically acclaimed The Wire. It''s such a great TV series that even a 20,000 word review would struggle to explain every single thing about the show that works, and I know you''re about as willing to read a post that long as I am willing to write one, so I''ll try not to draw this one out too much. That being said, there''s a lot about this show that I want to say, and a lot of praise I''d love to throw its way, so here goes.The Sopranos works on so many different levels it''s staggering. It''s a complex character study, a tense crime drama, a relatable family drama, and sometimes it even feels like a weird, twisted sitcom. There''s moments of brutal and shocking realism right alongside surreal dream sequences and scenes ambiguous in nature. There''s suspense, black comedy, surprising deaths, and even the odd tear-jerking moment.Every character is fascinating, as barely anyone is purely good or purely evil- almost every character is a different shade of morally ambiguous grey, and this is what makes almost every character, major or minor, so interesting. The stand-out character of course is Tony Soprano; the show is about him after all. He is absolutely flawlessly played by James Gandolfini, who has done other stuff in his career, but never anything as memorable as his role as the lead in The Sopranos. Here is a character who feels like such a real person it''s damn near scary- I feel like I know Tony better than some people I see in real life on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. This is perhaps one of the most fleshed-out and well-developed characters in the history of entertainment. Throughout the 6 seasons we see dozens of Tony''s therapy sessions, with each one adding something to the character. We see many of his dreams too, with these sequences putting the viewer directly into his head and allowing us to see his most personal thoughts and feelings. He interacts with countless other characters too; in fact, almost every character in the show interacts with Tony on at least one occasion. It''s a credit to both Gandolfini and the writers that the character of Tony Soprano felt so real throughout the show''s run.That''s not to say Tony''s the only well-developed character on the show, because that''s not true at all. Almost every character has depth and is interesting in their own way- personal favourite characters of mine include Livia Soprano, Tony''s delightfully crabby mother who''s obsessed with control, Ralph Cifaretto, an absolutely horrible colleague of Tony''s who is so much fun to despise, and Adrianna, a character who starts out as being there mainly for fan service, but becomes one of the show''s most sympathetic and interesting characters further down the line. I would like to talk more about the characters, but honestly, to do so may cause this review to move into spoiler territory, because like I said before, nobody on this show is ever really safe from death. One character may appear to be the kind of person who''d last all six seasons, but may well be "whacked" after just a few episodes. On the other hand, there''s characters who could only be seen in the background occasionally throughout the first season who become significant characters in later seasons. What I''m trying to get at is that the show''s unpredictable and I don''t want to go into discussing specific plot-lines or characters too much because you''re really better off going into this series knowing as little as possible in order to get the most enjoyment out of it.And by the way, try not to read too much about the show on the internet either before or while you''re watching it, as it''s an old-ish show, and that means people are generally less cautious about displaying spoiler warnings prior to discussing potentially "sensitive" material. The internet is a dangerous place to be while you''re watching a show that''s already aired, so just remember to be cautious.The use of music in this show is also something that really needs mentioning. The show uses music frequently, and also uses a great range of music throughout its run. David Chase and the others who wor', '23 April 2020');

Didn''t get much of it at the time. I didn''t see so much significance in it as I wasn''t the WWII history aficionado as I am now.I have a collection of countless WWII history documentaries, and many WWII dramas. After watching many, some of them quite interesting and compelling then recently getting the Blue Ray version of this series, it''s obvious the "The World at War" is the definitive series of the genre.Firstly, in 1973 even while the BBC was filming this some 28''ish years after the war, there were a lot people around from the war to interview. So the series is full of wonderful interviews from people that were there.The deep baritone voice narration keeps the whole thing compelling, albeit some times difficult to watch/grasp to do the nature. And there is some pretty large volume series, maybe 10 or so volumes, but nothing matches this series in size and completeness.Now as another reviewer pointed out there is undoubtedly some bias. As with any such history recount there are often different political views.It all depends on who is telling the story. For instance here in America when I was a child I was taught that certain late 1800 generals were basically hero''s for fighting Indians (Native Americans). But in reality it turns out that were actually brutal killers involved in more of a massacre of the people.Also there is just differing opinions on the how and why somethings happened in WWII. For instance with the "Battle of Dunkirk" some historians suggested that it was a big blunder by Hitler allowing the British soldiers to escape, while a more contemporary view is that it was more an issue of logistics.You have to make your own study with a "gain of salt" and come to your own conclusions. Why I suggest you watch several documentaries and read the books by "Albert Speer" (for more of an German inside view), etc.While on the subject, it''s actually kind of a shame in WWII dramas (fictional and partly historical) where things are often distorted and twisted for dramatic effect. While almost every German is the bad guy and usually all demonized et al. For example, I''m sure the average German solider didn''t know much about the genocide at all, and was not involved in any untoward brutality. He was too busy being a solider as any solider is conscripted to do. From various other documentaries it shows the Japanese were just as inhuman, if not more so. Also it overshadows other genocidal dictators like Stalin and Mao Ze-Dong responsible for around twice and at least five times as many deaths respectively! Often of there own people even! I''m not sympathizing, nor taking sides. There was undoubtedly unprecedented evil in the Nazi regime, but contorting the truth and turning the facts more into a fantasy is a disservice. If you really want to understand how things came about, how a country was turned around into such a hating war machine, plus how to advance as a world civilization and not have such things happen again then you have to embrace the facts.The movies want a great bad guy to hate, but it always isn''t the facts. I would like to see more movies like "Das Boot", "Letters from Iwo Jima", etc., that show somewhat of a different point of view. Although these are still "Hollywoodized" by making things okay/politically correct because they all die in the end, etc.I digress. If you want to see a great documentary for entertainment and to study a part of WWII watch this excellent BBC "The World at War" series!', '12 September 2011');

So when I saw the preview for "Game of Thrones" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn''t have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I''ve actually got faces to add to the characters that I''ve been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. "Game of Thrones" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script.

The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George''s earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as "bigger than Helms Deep" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect ''favorites''.

Whatever your age, `Cosmos'' is one of those great landmarks in the making of anything for the screen, whether the big one or the small one.Previous to this wonderful series, I had only heard Vangelis'' music in `Chariots of Fire'', but with the selection used in `Cosmos'' I have become the firmest stalwart of this brilliant Greek musician and composer. Who can forget such delightful pieces as `Entends-tu les Chiens Aboyer'' and - on my LP recording! - the Bulgarian Shepherdess Song, as well as the other pieces used to such effective advantage for this unrepeatable TV documentary series? This is a series that should be repeated again and again. Outstandingly brilliant.Many thanks to the late Professor Carl Sagan and to KCET, Los Angeles.', '22 February 2004');

I was 13 years old, and went to school as everyday. Just before noon teachers started running, closing all doors and windows, and telling us to stay inside, that the air is radioactive. One hour later we were given Lugol''s iodine (still remember its awful taste). There was discussion if we can safely go home. No one knew any details. Composition of beautiful weather and gloomy atmosphere was unreal. Years later, I know what was happening in the background. In morning hours of April 28th one of the stations of Polish Central Laboratory for Radiation Protection (CLRP) in northeast Poland measured radiation exceeding normal level half million times.Two hours later they knew it was reactor explosion, somewhere. Government crisis meeting took all 28th/29th night. Polish prime minister called his Russian counterpart, only to hear he "knows nothing" about any nuclear accident. By 3am "Polish Legasov", prof. Zbigniew Jaworowski from CLRP was called to join the meeting, and he achieved impossible - convinced Polish communists that the worst should be expected. They decided to give iodine to all children and suspend production of milk and vegetables countrywide, starting from the next day (east part of the country first).
Chernobyl - I''ve never written movie review. I''ve never seen such an accurate depiction of how communist country operates. How it looks. I was literally time-traveled over 30 years back.

Now, over three decades later, the next edition of "Cosmos" retains the integrity of the original series while providing the latest findings in science and astronomy.Carl Sagan was a true Renaissance man, who synthesized history, philosophy, art, and science in the Cosmos series and the superb book that accompanied the program. Now, one of our finest scientists, Neil deGrasse Tyson, serves as our guide to the universe with outstanding commentary in the sequel. There was an especially moving moment when Professor Tyson recalled the time when he was warmly greeted by Carl Sagan, who took time out of his busy schedule to provide a personal tour of the Cornell campus when Tyson was about to enter college.It is impressive that a television personality on the order of Seth MacFarlane would produce this series that includes animated recreations of historical events, such as the trial and execution of the seventeenth century "heretic" Giordano Bruno. The animations are a cut above the generic dramatizations with actors, wherein the bottom drops out of most television documentaries.In the Academic Awards telecast hosted by MacFarlane, he closed the show with a star turn in singing "Here''s to the Losers."

Ambrose) was the most expensive TV undertaking of its day, costing a massive $120 million to produce. And, as the old saying goes, every penny is up there on the screen. Borne from the success of Spielberg''s SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - with which it shares a similar dramatic and visual style - BAND OF BROTHERS'' recreation of a glorious (and hard-won) chapter in American history assumed an even greater patriotic significance during its initial US broadcast, when it coincided with the horrific events of September 2001. Written with economy and grace, and directed with emotional intensity by a series of directors (including Phil Alden Robinson, Richard Loncraine and Hanks himself) whose combined efforts achieve a genuine aesthetic uniformity, the movie is a masterpiece of storytelling and historical documentation. Punctuated by horrific battle sequences, in which the camera is placed within mere inches of the death and destruction, the film transcends its educational remit by focusing intently on the human cost of war. Almost every episode opens with testimony from surviving members of Easy Company (none of whom are identified until the end of the series), which further strengthens the emphasis which BAND OF BROTHERS - book and film - places on the bonds which drew them together in times of conflict. And, because it''s a true story, there''s no telling from one episode to the next which of the ''characters'' will live or die, which makes it all the more potent and visceral.The entire production represents quality writ large: Beautifully filmed on various European locations (including the UK and Austria), the movie is noble without being the least bit pompous or austere, and it manages to humanize a large cast of essential characters with small touches of humanity and humor, all of which serves to heighten the sense of terror as they descend into the maelstrom of conflict. The first - and longest - episode is deceptively staid, featuring David Schwimmer (a long way from TV''s "Friends") as a cowardly, bullying commanding officer whose tyrannical methods nevertheless shaped Easy Company into a fighting force which eventually cut a swathe through the heart of occupied Europe. Brit actor Damian Lewis takes the spotlight thereafter as Easy Company''s most respected platoon leader, with Ron Livingston as his right hand man. Other standout performances in a flawless cast include Matthew Settle as battle-hardened platoon leader Ronald Speirs whose wartime career was distinguished by numerous acts of bravery (fuelled by a unique - if morbid - personal philosophy), Shane Taylor as company medic Eugene Roe, Neal McDonough as 2nd lieutenant ''Buck'' Compton (laid low by his horrific combat experiences), and Donnie Wahlberg as 1st sergeant C. Carwood Lipton, who maintained the morale of his fellow soldiers, even when the odds seemed stacked against them. Every episode has its merits, but stand-outs include David Leland''s ''Bastogne'' (ep. 6), which recounts the horrendous circumstances surrounding Easy Company''s involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, and David Frankel''s ''Why We Fight'' (ep. 9), in which the full horror of the Nazi regime is uncovered in a German forest. Additionally, the closing moments of chapter 10 (''Points'', directed by Mikael Salomon) are truly heartbreaking.It''s doubtful that a more fitting tribute to the men of Easy Company could have been devised than BAND OF BROTHERS, a truly remarkable film in every conceivable way. By turns engrossing, provocative and *deeply* moving, it stands as a testament to those who fought and died for our freedoms, almost a lifetime ago.', '4 May 2005');

We lived in a hungarian town close to the croatian border and the life in that town was pretty simple apart from that day.

The miniseries was intended to be a sort of fleshed-out Saving Private Ryan, and the battlefield footage is very similar to the movie. Band of Brothers is totally unpredictable with merciless death that comes around, suddenly and graphically to almost all the characters that the audiences will get to know and love over the course of the 10-hour series.Band of Brothers pulls a lot of punches when it comes to showing the horrors of war. Like Saving Private Ryan, which also boasts the marquee executive producing powerhouses in Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the battlefield scenes here are so pulse-poundingly realistic and graphic, chaotic and terrifying, that viewers will be riveted, if not a little sick to their stomachs. Unless they know a bit about WWII history, they may also be confused as to who''s fighting whom and why it matters. But unlike Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers has the screen time to flesh out who''s inside the soldier''s uniform. Audiences will get to know each character in the unit as the series unfolds, so when one is killed, it''s more heart crushing to watch. We see the soldiers rank each other out, train together, fight together, and then, all too often, grieve for each other.The series ends after the war does, showing how the soldiers who made it through then struggled to reintegrate themselves into civilian and family life. Though Band of Brothers is fictionalized, many of the events shown occurred to real people in precisely the way depicted onscreen, a fact driven home by many talking-head interviews with real-life Easy Company members, now senior citizens, who reflect both bitterly and nostalgically on their tours of duty.Overall, This is by far one of the best mini-series ever made by HBO. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes WWII, action or drama. Band of Brothers is very realistically violent in places just to get the message around. It is unbelievable that a show of such high quality and content could be produced way back in 2000. Band of Brothers is by far the best material that is available on film in war genre, with apocalypse now coming a distant second. I never do this but Band of Brothers is 10 stars out of ten.

While it is certainly hinted at and quite exposed in actual audio tapes, the lack of that important "green" paper trail to the military contractors supplying this atrocity left a giant hole in this entire series. Surely while presidents wrestle with their "moral conscience" in some parts, left out is the political pressure from contractors to further line their pockets in exchange for votes and support.I wish a real Part 11 existed to show the public, especially kids how important money will drive us down a terrible path of mass killing and destruction in the name of an unwinnable cause known since 1964.The commentary was compelling and unimaginable (in hindsight) how anybody thought this was a good cause or even heroic.

For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko''s Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.Of course, this isn''t the first form of media that has incorporated the power of the elements, but their method of how they do it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is truly inspiring.All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he''s a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.The brilliance of this show is that it is perfectly paced. Sure, you get the occasional filler episode, but every episode (leaving out The Great Divide) has a purpose and adds more layers to this intriguing story and the world it is set in.Again, for a children''s show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a ''kids show'', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much.

It serves as a superb introduction, for those born after WWII, to an enormous conflict that radically re-shaped the world around us and subjected our grandparents/parents to dreadful hardship.
The series begins slowly, with an episode on Hitler''s and the Nazi party''s rise to power. It does skip a  great deal of material on the origins and growth of National Socialism... but I suppose that is only to be expected. Despite being an epic thirty-two hours in length there is only so much time, and much material not directly about the war had to be skipped.It is a fine antidote to the drivel put out by film studios... which, for the most part, show the war being almost entirely fought by the U.S.A, with the British involved in a few skirmishes here and there. Little do they realise the scale of British fighting and loss. Perhaps even more importantly it gives coverage of one of the most undervalued (particularly by Commie-bashing Hollywood) that Russia suffered more losses than any other country in WWII. Without their sacrifice it would have been a different outcome.I can''t stress enough how good this series is.

To document WWII as mere history is to marginalize it as merely another fact on an eventual high school exam. To merely acknowledge that it was war merely because war is a terrible thing is to ignore its consequence, and its undeniable relevance to the lives of everyone that followed them.To confer the proper deference to the death and honor of those uncounted soldiers, we must integrate into our souls the reality of living as their beneficiaries at the expense of their lives. While there is no absolute way to understand the cost of World War II, we can experience the barest shadow of its reality by seeing it through the eyes of those who fought it, who lived through it, who saw death on an unimaginable scale during it, and preserved a free world as a result. That shadow is a magnificent humility captured in a simply brilliant HBO miniseries, "Band of Brothers." "Brothers" sheds the narcissism of the television camera to bring you face-to-face with the dramatized-yet-real faces of the men of Easy Company, one of hundreds of American and allied forces to invade Europe in an effort to stem Nazi Germany''s military machine. "Brothers" compels the viewer to see World War II on a personal level unmatched by virtually any other war production. You see not glorified geniuses of war, but hardened, otherwise average men, fearless and fearful, heroic and imperfect, lucky and unlucky, thrown into an incomprehensible maelstrom of war and savagery. They emerge not merely as a force that won a war, but one that established the foundation on which a generation''s freedom was built, and through which the unspeakable savagery exacted on a race was exposed."Band of Brothers" isn''t for the fainthearted. It offers an unapologetically graphic and frank depiction of war and the men who fight it, bringing home in a vivid and undeniable way. From the simplicity of the training centers to the brutality of near-abandonment in the forests of Bastogne under German siege, "Brothers" offers a lesson that should be mandatory for the eyes, hearts, and minds of those too young to know of World War II as anything other than an historical event, such that some measure of the price of freedom and the cost of tyranny can be interwoven into the souls of those who watch it. To say "Band of Brothers" is merely extraordinary is to diminish its sheer greatness not merely as a work of television, but as a demonstration of freedom''s 20th-century turning point.To appreciate your freedom, and understand in an inherently deficient way its benefactors, "Band of Brothers" is simply not to be missed.-David', '13 April 2005');

This one is done with Lynn Novick and possesses the gift for combining the realities of the Vietnam war from Eisenhower through the Ford administrations comprising five presidencies for nearly 20 years and includes the historical, sociological, and psychological aspects of the war with background music from that era of conflict. It is a brilliant work. No matter where one falls on the scale of opinion of the war this documentary will not fail to present a complete and balanced chronology of one our nation''s most divisive eras and a war that evokes controversy to this day. One might say this nation really never got over its effects and that our nation has never been the same since it.The work brought back to me the issues from that era. Both the anti-war movements and those who supported the war are most fairly reflected. There was almost no one who experienced the war who was not conflicted by it. As one who was involved in the anti-war movement of that time it brought back memories I have stored for all these years and it does it through the eyes of the soldiers who fought it, thought it was worth fighting, as well as those soldiers who joined veterans against the war groups opposed to it. It also touches on figures we remember today such as John McCain a tortured and beaten for six years POW as well as others who fought it and eventually opposed it like Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. It includes the famous opposition to the war such as Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin, Rennie Davis, Oliver Stone who fought in the war and groups such as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and other groups who were sometimes violently against it. It includes the Kent State massacre as well. It is the fullest most complete rendition of the the historical events leading up to the American involvement in the war and also includes interviews of North Vietnam vets and their perspective on it. It brings you through the present era which shows a relaxed Communist state employing some capitalist enterprise to propel Vietnam economically into the 21st century.

But the most important thing that this film shows is that the soviet authoritiies lied to people about this catastrophe all the time. For example, in Kiev which is 130 km from Chernobyl, nobody knew about the high levels of radiation till the middle of May, they even held a parade on the first of May, when the level of radiation in Kiev was 100 times higher than normal (iodine131 isotope) and nobody gave us the iodine pills.

It''s pretty easy to forget when all you have to do to feed yourself is PUT THAT BURGER in your mouth. You guys forgetting what is wild reality about? To survive!

I won''t compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn''t about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore.

Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series.

While the U.S. propped up a corrupt government in the south of the country, the other side was fighting less for communism, and more for the freedom of their homeland. They were always going to win, precisely because they could not go home to somewhere else. And the amazing thing is, that the American government to a large extent shared this analysis; and nonetheless, sent thousands of their people to die in a lost cause. Many times that number of Vietnamese perished in 30 years of conflict.Ken Burns and Lynn Novick have made a superb documentary about this war. Occasionally sentimental, it''s nonetheless unflinching in its portrayal of the essential stupidity of the American involvement, and with numerous eye-witnesses on both sides giving testimony alongside a remarkable amount of historic footage: this was perhaps the first war truly fought on camera.

Just saying the name evokes memories of science''s best and most eloquent educator, Carl Sagan. By no means a slouch in the scientific field -- he was a planetary scientist who first hypothesized and presented the idea of "nuclear winter" -- Sagan will forever be known for a phrase he never said: "billions and billions" (it was actually die-hard Sagan fan Johnny Carson parodying his science idol). Make all the jokes you want about Sagan''s plosive enunciation of "billions" (which he always did to make it distinct from "millions"), Sagan defined what makes great science television for a generation.The 13 episodes of this Peabody and Pulitzer willing miniseries touch on nearly every science topic of importance: astronomy, cosmology, physics, biology, the mathematics of gigantic numbers, and relativity. It also indulges us in a targeted survey of science history, including sections on the Library of Alexandria, the birth of science experiment, the defeat of ancient Greek science by mysticism, and the lives of Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe (the original Odd Couple), James Goddard, and Edwin Hubble.Episodes 1, "On the Shores of the Cosmic Ocean", and 13, "Who Speaks for Earth?", provide matching capstones for the other 11 volumes, which jump wildly from topic to topic. And yet there is a coherency across the entire run. Whether Sagan is describing conditions on the surface of Venus, the effects of relativity, or the futility of writing out a googolplex, Sagan is our patient, encouraging, engaging guide, making sense to the layman of complex scientific concepts. The script, written by Sagan and future wife Ann Druyan, educated and entertained. Only occasionally did Sagan''s delivery approach pretentiousness, but his own enthusiasm for the topics effectively foils any from creeping in.If you''ve read one of the Sagan biographies that emerged after his premature death in 1996, you''ll know that one of the most effective and clever devices used in the series, the "Ship of the Imagination", was actually forced upon Sagan by executive producer Adrian Malone. This was one of the very few times that Sagan was wrong, because Malone''s concept allowed us to step into cosmological situations much more believably than if we were presented simply with Sagan''s exposition.Although by all accounts the two men hated each other to the point of fisticuffs, Sagan and Malone''s production surpassed all previous efforts at science documentary and continues to set the standard for all who have come since.

It''s probably safe to say, when dealing with a series of novels as beloved as The Song of Ice and Fire, the most scrutinized aspect of the T.V. adaptation will be how well it holds to the source material. I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.While certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.Special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.All and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.UPDATEAfter watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).Top form, HBO.

Jazz documentary, it''s hard to not notice how there is due to the period its about that there''s a distinct lack of footage to drawn upon. The Vietnam War is the opposite, as Burns and Lynn Novick draw upon a massive plethora of footage from all sides, from the combat bolex 16mm photographers to footage from the Vietcong and in Hanoi to the protesters and (thank goodness) lots and lots of juicy never-before-heard (or little heard) audio tapes from Johnson and Kennedy and so on. But at the same time if it was just that it would make for some compelling viewing and still only be as far as that, some good footage showing us things about Vietnam most of us don''t know about or may have forgotten since school (or if one does know a lot about, like I''ve seen in social media, there may be holes to poke, but I digress).No, what gets this the full 5-stars is that its master storytellers at a peak: this is the story of Vietnam from all of the conceivable angles: the hundred year or so lead-up to how the French were finally driven out of Vietnam by Ho Chi Minh (who quoted from US *the Declaration of Independence* in his speech after the French were gone to his people) to the years in the 50''s when that divide between North and South sewed the seeds of all the problems that were to come, and then how the very first Americans died in *1959*, and then all of the perspectives: the US Military; the presidencies; the anti-war protesters; the soldiers recounting back on the US side AND the Vietnamese (especially the Vietnamese); the parents and family members of service members; locals and civilians in Vietnam, north and south. Every step of the way we are drawn in through the step-by-step process and how it was kind of inexorable; the US could have gotten out at multiple points, but due to the Cold War, Communism, a gargantuan sense of pride as WW2 and Korea had come in the recent consciousness, they were stuck in a civil war that they should have not been a part of.In other words, Burns/Novick are charting all of the history that can fit into ten hours, and I''m sure if there are Vietnam war buffs they''ll say this or that is missing. For those who only know so much they lay it all out in such a way that is harrowing and achingly personal (look at episode 3 with the story of the teenage boy who feels it''s his duty so much to get into combat that he runs away for four months until his parents say it''s okay... and you realize this is not going to turn out well, but you try not to think of that while his story is told), through all of the interviews with real guys who fought and came back and the stare is still there after over forty/fifty years. There''s regret, there''s trying to put things into context, there''s more regret, there''s footage that shows more than one might expect about the trepidation of the soldiers then (a hard-assed marine captain who admitted in an interview he wished he could have 200 of the Vietcong as they were "good soldiers").There''s so much to wrestle with here about American Imperialism - if not the beginning of it, then the crystallization of it - the entrenchment of politics through combat (Johnson doomed himself through not going more for peace and instead digging in to his advisors - and then of course Nixon, good lord that walking-talking curse word) - and then how real people, citizens being fed from the trough of anti-Communism (and on the flip-side how the Americans were exactly like the French, like there were no differences at all, as Western-European invaders), and it''s both dense and easy to follow.

The second was ''De Tweeling'', a Dutch film about two twin-sisters, separated in 1926. One of them grows up in Nazi-Germany, the other in The Netherlands. That movie shows us more of the common persons during the war, Germans and not-Germans. The third was ''Band of Brothers'', a true story about combat in the war. All three things are great, the films I mean, and you definitely should see all three of them.''Band of Brothers'' follows Easy-company from their training in England, through D-Day, the rest of France (including Bastogne), Holland (including operation Market Garden), Germany and Austria. This story is shown to us in ten different episodes. Every episode starts with the real men from Easy-company telling about their experiences and ends with a short written update of Easy-company. Between beginning and ending of episodes one of the best things I have seen on screen is presented to us.The casting is amazing. Even David Schwimmer (from ''Friends'') as the bitter Captain Sobel is great. Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston are superb as Major Winters and Captain Lewis Nixon. Every actor seems to be perfect for his character. The photography and direction is great also. I especially loved the direction of the episode done by executive producer Tom Hanks, possibly with some help from the other executive producer Steven Spielberg. ''Saving Private Ryan'' was great for showing us the horror in combat, ''Band of Brothers'' does the same thing but adds some other things.

The set of the "space craft" -- what there is of it -- looks less like a 2050 suite in a Las Vegas hotel. The music is more dramatic. And Neil DeGrasse Tyson is the host because Sagan is no longer with us.Tyson is not Sagan. He''s pleasant, looks good, sounds convincing, but there are times when his narration acquires a sing-song quality that turns the explanation into an address to a group of kids on a field trip from some nearby middle school. He''s not Sagan, but then who is? I liked Sagan a great deal. He was of the moment -- longish hair, cool looking, bell bottom trousers, and he smoked grass once in a while. I also liked him because he was on the faculty when I was in graduate school and he could have chosen to drop in on my comprehensive oral exams and ask me what life would look like on a planet identical to earth except for a complete absence of calcium. (He didn''t.)But that doesn''t matter. As host, Tyson may not be as familiar a figure as Sagan was -- God, Sagan was all over the telly -- but he''s likable in his own right. And there is no question of his knowing his subject, beginning at the Bronx High School of Science and reaching dazzling heights thereafter.There is an expectable amount of continuity between this program, which is a sort of up-dated sequel, and the original. One writer, Ann Druyan, had a hand in both. So we have the cosmic calendar which reduces the chronology of the universe to a single year. And even some expressions are carried over -- "star stuff." I can''t wait until Tyson gets to Sagan''s awesome "holy of holies." I thrilled the first time around.I do have a problem though, regarding chronology. "Cosmos" appeared in 1980. This show is appearing in 2014. Let''s see. Sums were never my forte, but my pocket calculator tells me that 2014 minus 1980 is equal to 34. That means I''m 34 years older than I was when I watched the original. I hope Tyson is all finished dealing with the dimension of time. Let''s move on to something else in the next episode -- pronto.Anyway, if he''s so smart I''d have some questions for him. If the universe or universes are expanding, what are they expanding INTO? And if everything that exists started with the Big Bang of 13 billion years ago, what caused that Big Bang in the first place? And where did all those original hydrogen atoms COME from? Who''s pulling the wool over whose eyes around here? Of course that gets us into metaphysics and he has nothing to say about it in this introductory episode, the only one I''ve seen.

There''s a lot in this), but all of these pieces come together to form a show greater than the sum of their parts. It begins as a story about children initially for children, but the characters within this mature as does the subject material and range of the target audience. The tone doesn''t become some cheap grim-dark escalation piece because there''s always a sense of identity from the first episode to the last.What makes this show incredible is how it blends rich colourful storytelling that aims to entertain with deeper nearly philosophical structures beneath it. It''s subtle. It''s clever. You can watch it again and again and pick up new pieces each time. The story itself is about a child named Aang who finds himself in a world he doesn''t belong in - quite literally, as he had been frozen for about a century and ''woke up'' in this world. The protagonist is a young boy named Aang and is, as the title suggests, the last Airbender - a sect of humans with the ability to manipulate the air around him, such as using it for his glider to fly higher and for catching himself when he falls. In this world there are 4 kinds of bender: Earth, Fire, Air, Water. In this world, you are born into these sects. Mastering a single form of bending can take a lifetime. Aang however is special, he is the Avatar, the one person who can use all 4 elements and uses this power to maintain the piece between the 4 bending peoples. He has had hundreds of past lives as the Avatar, and has a spiritual connection to each of his past lives, but ran away from his training before connecting with his spiritual past selves.Once awoken, Aang finds out that the world he left behind to be in turmoil as the nation of the Firebenders have begun to use their strength to conquer the world, slaying every Airbender in the hopes to kill the Avatar. The world has assumed the Avatar line is broken and Aang died long ago, such as the two young Waterbenders that awaken Aang in the pilot episode. These two, Katara and Sokka, are two young kids left parent-less by this war, with Katara the only Waterbender in her whole tribe, as the Firebenders remove anyone capable of waterbending in fear of rebellion. Throughout the first series, Aang must learn how to waterbend from Katara - a task that is not without slip ups. The plot begins as a simple coming of age story, but quickly takes to tackling far more mature themes from the deeds of Aang''s past life to struggling acceptance that not everyone can be saved, in thought provoking greying morality where right and wrong are nothing more than tidal forces. Each season introduces a new element for Aang to master until finally he must retake the responsibilities of the Avatar and bring balance to the world.This show has so many layers that there is without doubt a character for everyone. There are powerful, well defined story arcs, but within episodes, there are simple adventures that let each character grow and develop into almost real people. There is a plot about redemption from one of the show''s main antagonist, Zuko, son of the Fire Nation''s supreme leader, Fire Lord Ozai, exploring the morality of what it means to be born into the baddies side of things that in itself deserves the highest awards in plot writing. One of the main characters, the water tribe born Sokka, does not have any super powers but still tries to stand on the shoulders of giants. His grievance that the world is not fair to his attempts to become a man is an enthralling story of acceptance and overcoming limitations. The earthbender companion, Toph, introduced in the second season, is blind and thought of as helpless. She struggles with being thought of as less than everyone else for a disability she was born with, and is as stubborn as the rocks she bends. Seeing her open up and begin to trust her friends enough to let them in is heart warming and portrays human emotion in an incredibly believable light. Even the world itself is a living, breathing thing, the plot lines revolving around the animals of the world are near parable in nature without ever coming off as overly preachy or boring.

At the time of the Chernobyl catastrophe I was eleven, a fifth-grader at school. One day at the end of April, or it might be early May, I came back home after classes and saw my mother, who was a radiologist, talking on the phone to somebody very gravely. As soon as I opened the door with my key on a strap that we used to wear around necks, and stepped in, my mother asked me covering the telephone reciever with one hand if it was raining outside. I said it was drizzling a bit in the morning. She told me to immediately go and wash my hair, and so I did. Then she poured milk into a mug, added three drops of iodine and said that I had to drink that. I remember asking her if iodine was edible, and she just said that''s what she was instructed to do by a friend. I drank it. Still my mum couldn''t explain anything clearly, so I felt quite unaware of what was happening for quite a long time unti bits and pieces of what had happened started to unwrap after the collapse of the USSR.
When I got older I read Svetlana Alexievich''s Voices from Chernobyl/Chernobyl Prayer. It was a very hard and slow read as the stories told were horrifying. And now this series, four episodes of which I binge-watched yesterday, took me back to the eighties in the Soviet Belarus. I recognize everything in this half-docu, although I''ve never been to Pripyat. My mom is originally from a small town on the Dnieper - the mouth of the Pripyat river - in the Gomel region in the south of Belarus, and we used to visit it every year before the Chernobyl. Then we stopped, as we felt scared and cautious, and I went there again only when I was an adult. The series left me in tears. It all looks even more frightning than we could imagine. The course of events is being told quite clearly and accurately from what I''ve known. The actors look pretty Russian/Belarusian/Ukranian to me, and all the locations - from the regional hospitals and the nuclear plant interior to Minsk and Moscow administrative buildings and science institutions look very authentic and detectable. Ulana Khomyuk migh be a fictional character, but there was indeed such a character - Vassili Nesterenko, a Soviet and Belorusian physicist and a former director of the Institute of Nuclear Energy at the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (1977-1987) who informed the first secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus Nikolai Slunkov (whose BD is on April 26 by coincidence) that the dosimeters showed the elevated dose of ionizing radiation. Nesterenko also was one of the liquidators of the Chernobyl accident anc the aftermath - he threw liquid nitrogen containers from a helicopter on the burning reactor core. To do this he had to move into the middle of radioactive smoke. Despite the heavy radioactive contamination of the area, Vassili Nesterenko survived (he died in 2008). However, three out of the four passengers of his helicopter died from radioactive irradiation and contamination.
And one more fact: the literal translation of Chernobyl (Chernaya Byl) is The Black True Tale.', '29 May 2019');

Vietnam was in my face from the time I was in 8th grade until I was out of college. It was always there simmering, occasionally boiling, usually tasteless during that part of my life. I had a high school buddy killed over there. I had other friends come back and tell of horrible and exciting things they witnessed and did there. I saw the new stories, the TV reports, the magazines, the radio news. I was flooded with information, but there was no singular narrative that could link it all together. The Presidents said one thing, our soldiers said another, news reporters another and our enemies something completely different. What was the truth about that catastrophe?Well, Ken Burns and Lynn Novick really did their homework. After decades of mastering how to tell a long story through the documentary process, they used their collective knowledge (and you can tell a passion) to finally get to the bottom of Vietnam. But they professionally decided, as always, not to tell their story. No, they captured all the elements then aligned them, in a time- tested way, in which the truth finally comes through. Including many shameful truths I was never aware of.I''m sure with all the footage from news networks, presidential libraries, international sources, enemy footage, and personal media— they had more material than ever to go through. Yet every segment of the eighteen hours seems essential. They tell the big story, the military story, the political story, the cultural stories, the generational story, the secret story, the personal stories and the follow up story—all brilliantly.If I had to be critical about anything, well, maybe it''s a bit too long. They methodically look at each year of the war. By the time you get to Nixon, you feel like you''ve seen enough of the jungles, the treachery of the enemy, the American firepower, the same futility many times before. Oh, there''s always a new fact, or a different person interviewed who shares their view and pain. But truthfully, after a while, I found myself a little restless.But, perhaps that tedium is part of the deep thinking, the intelligence behind this monumental documentary. The war was long, painful tedious, and it morphed into different entities as it dragged on. You could read that in a book, someone can tell you, but through ten nights you can almost feel the weight, the plague of that awful mess.I''m convinced this Vietnam documentary will be and should be a course in schools; an essential opus of study and discovery for one of the most complicated, expensive and divisive periods of our history.', '1 October 2017');

It is an investment. 10 episodes, most of them 2 hours long, at times admittedly redundant, but packed with incredible insight, astounding footage, and all kinds of juicy political revelations. I have heard some criticisms that this documentary leans favorably towards Communism and does not celebrate American soldiers enough. I would beg of anybody to watch this to put aside their political views when watching this beautiful documentary. Many times during my viewings, I thought I had a firm stance on something that occurred during the war and then somebody would come on and share their view on the subject. Immediately, my view was shaken, if not changed altogether. I can''t say that the film looks favorably or unfavorably on any particular political party or ''side'' if you will. All I can tell you is that everybody, from VietCong farmer, anti-war protesters, prisoners of wars to ambassadors all have plenty of screen time to share their perspective. And in a nutshell, that''s what blew me away about this documentary. The different perspectives that arose. I am only convinced of one thing after seeing this documentary, there simply is no answers on this war. And certainly no obvious truths. War is complex, war is hell, war wounds and war heals. You can go into this thing looking to vilify Nixon, slander the VietCong, lambaste antiwar protesters, but I assure you you will walk away having learnt something and fostered a new outlook.

While the bad side of drug /gang wars is plain to see this show also addresses why such problems exist i.e the lack of adequate schooling, housing and the complete lack of community spirit. The police as an organisation are also shown to be as morally corrupt as the gangsters. With corruption and racism still a problem and the inertia of the commanders who rather than tackling problems are wholly consumed by their ambition for power and rank.

Let me introduce you The Wire, the best TV show put on small screens. The show that will, after you''ve finished it, live you empty inside, because you''ll never find another TV show that can rival it. With it''s five seasons, The Wire raised the bar of quality for TV shows, the bar that no TV show to date has managed to reach. The Wire''s story is set in the city of Baltimore, and it''s about the slow fall of Baltimore city, about the pointlessness of the war on drugs, the bureaucracy and corruption that infest both the police force and drug-dealing gangs, class war against the labor unions, and the city''s dysfunctional public schools system. And it''s all shown through the perspective of law enforcement and drug dealers. As the story goes, you''ll encounter well thought out plot twists, and you''ll see a lot of characters die, because, as David Simon said: "We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. The Wire is making an argument about what institutions—bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even—do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I''m afraid, a somewhat angry show.", and that makes the show so great, because deaths have meanings and consequences, and aren''t just there for the shock factor like in Game Of Thrones. It also helps that Simons knows what he''s talking about since he was writing a lot for the Baltimore Sun, and he saw a lot of things on the streets that are portrayed in the show. One of the things I really love about The Wire is that characters aren''t all good or all bad. They''re gray, when it comes to their morality. Simon challenges the viewer to like characters, a lot of characters will do some bad things, and you''ll probably agree on a lot of them given the situation they''re in. The writing is just great, The Wire has a web of a lot of characters and the show spins them well. From McNulty to Stringer Bell, there are a lot of complex and great written characters, but there are also some weaker ones, but that''s also to be expected, because the show has more than the hundred characters and you can''t expect that they''ll all be on the same level of writing. There is no plot armor in this show, a lot of characters will die, and, as I''ve already said, their deaths have consequences, and aren''t just meant to be shock factor. Acting team consists of familiar HBO actors, and of real cops and criminals, and they all did a pretty damn good job. Some are weaker, and that is most notable during season 1 and 5, but weak actor aren''t that usual in the show, so don''t worry. I''d say the best actor is easily Dominic West as McNulty, who stole the show for me, but since I''m biased towards McNulty, don''t take my word for granted. The only problem I had with the The Wire was one of fifth season''s arcs, the one with the newspapers. It felt out of place for me, and it wasn''t that interesting. It didn''t introduce interesting characters nor was it on par with The Wire''s better arcs.In the end, The Wire did what little to no TV show could hope to do, it succeed with it''s extremely ambitious, and I''d say impossible mission to tell a story of Baltimore''s crumble. The social commentary, the writing on the characters, the well thought out plot twists, great directory, and David Simon''s expertise on the case made The Wire the best television show ever seen on small screens. Enjoy the ride while it lasts, because once it ends, you''ll be left with an empty whole within yourself, because they''ll never be a TV show that could rival The Wire.

Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird''s-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it''s near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does."All the pieces matter," a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it''s understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show "boring" or "slowly paced" or "overrated" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two. I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you''ll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show''s power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them.

It was more "Hey lets get our bodies back" and learn about the Elric brothers and how their characters develop. In this series, we actually get to look forward to the ending because as the series progresses, we assume that there''s going to be a big finale that will completely decide the plot of the story.

This question is definitive for understanding "Chernobyl" mini-series.I was a kid living near Pryp''iat'' when the forth nuclear reactor exploded. Both of my parents worked at that Nuclear Power Plant. My sister went to school in Pryp''iat'' on April 26, 1986. Nobody told us nothing about the danger. Moreover, those, who wanted to leave Pryp''iat'' for personal reasons weren''t allowed to do so. Only after more than 36 hours after the disaster, on sunny Sunday evacuation begun. We were told that the evacuation is only a "temporally measure" and that we will come back to our homes on the next day, after they''ll "clean up" Pryp''iat''. Well, more than 30 years have passed since that promise. They told us nothing about the level of radiation, neither gave us potassium iodide. My parents, who went back as so-called "liquidators" told me that even in the May of 1986 they were deceived about the radioactivity level and didn''t receive potassium iodide. Most of their colleagues are dead by now. There were lie everywhere and about everything.The mini-series nailed most of that lies and show its consequences. The criminal and cowardice nature of the soviet government, the incompetence and fear of big and small "bosses" without proper education, but with big ambitions. The fear and meanness of careerists with black souls, ready to lie to the last and easily sacrifice others. Especially easily such liars are willing to sacrifice others. The conscript soldiers and reservists (which were called "partisans" by liquidators) who were sent to the roof to clear it from graphite are mostly dead by now. These "bio-robots" were sometimes misused, worked over the "safe" time, sent back more and more. Such dehumanization is terrifying. Evacuated people not only lost their homes and all their previous lives - they were doomed to diseases and "stigmatization" by society. Their lives were divided on "before" and "after" the disaster. In the May, 1986 along the roads near Pryp''at'' lay a lot of shot dogs - it was heartbreaking to see, my mother recalls. She was looking for our dog among those dead bodies.This is the real cost of lies. "The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all". Soviet atmosphere and life recreated as thoroughly as possible. Total lies, cowardice, incompetence and inhumanity of the system and its functionaries evoke memories and is as frighten as a revived corpse enchanted by necromancers from HBO. Craig Mazin has created a spiritualistic seance under the guise of the mini-series. The degree of immersion and horror is amazing. No horror film is capable of what reality is capable of. Musical accompaniment, background noises, absurdity and madness of what is happening on the screen, the doom of the performers of someone else''s will, going to suffering and death. And the total lie of all and about everything. All of these shown by wonderful actors cast, with tense dramatization, perfect ambient sounds and music. Deep and haunting show, with excellent balance between staying true to the real story and keeping audience in suspense despite the fact that we all know how the story ends.The whole soviet system was build on lies, on denial of truth. All we are eager to believe in convenient lies rather than to accept painful truth. And sooner or later such ignorance of reality inevitably leads us to collision with it - the real world reminds about itself ruthlessly to those, who are willing to live in dreams instead of reality. But when the lies became building material for the whole political system, the manifestation of truth can became catastrophic. Truth is like radiation - it is invisible and you can easily deny its existence until you begin to vomit and die from radiation sickness or, if "lucky", from cancer.P.S. Some commentators complains about the absence of "Russian language" are ridiculous - locals spoke Russian at best with their national accents. In small villages locals spoke Ukrainian or Belorussian or mixed both languages. Thereby one essential factor was missed in the mini-series. As liquidators joked with grim humor, in Pryp''iat'' Moscow wanted to extinguish all the national minorities - in 1986 conscripts from Latvia were "thrown" to Pryp''iat'', in 1987 - conscripts from Central Asia.

I don''t usually watch animes because I have grown out of them. Out of boredom, I decided to watch both FMA and FMA: Brotherhood and I must say, it was a pleasure. FMA(original) had an unique storyline and ending. The story did not follow the manga towards the later part of the series. I felt the story mainly focused on finding the philosopher stone. Along the way, viewers get to see a stronger connection between Al and Ed. There was also more emphasis on Scar and the Homunculi''s life and experiences. They barely touch upon Hohenheim (Ed and Al''s dad) which I thought had a large role in the story. I got a bit bored of the story towards the end because it got confusing and didn''t seem to flow properly. The ending was unique and good, but it did not satisfy viewers and it was kind of a cliff hanger even if you watched the movie. 8/10FMA: Brotherhood followed the manga, and it seemed to aim more towards "mainstream" animes. FMA: Brotherhood had several reoccurring voices, like Edward, Winry, and Roy Mustang, but it also lost some old voices such as Alphonse and Scar. It took some time to get over Al, but eventually it was fine. With the award-winning cast and some new additions, they improved from the original a lot. The relationship between Ed and Al was implied, so they focused on their relationship between other characters. They also didn''t focus on Edward 100% of the time (IMO, Ed was in like every scene in original). Instead, they gave Alphonse a lot of solo missions (and a bigger role), developed a new character named Greed/Lin, developed many other characters and had LESS EMPHASIS on the philosopher stone. Winry and Ed, Xing and Ling, Mai Chang and Al, Roy and Riza had they''re moments, if you know what I mean. Hohenheim(Elric) had a MUCH BIGGER role in this than the original which was definitely nice to see.

Our science teacher pimped the show mercilessly and every week the day after the broadcast we would discuss what might have been mentioned, compare ideas on what we thought about it, and usually have some good laughs aping the wonderful speech habits of Dr. Sagan.He became one of my heroes, as important as The Bionic Man, Captain Kirk, Peter Gabriel and David Bowie. I promptly had my parents supply me with not only the hardcover book edition, but one of the ubiquitous hooded parka jackets that became Sagan''s trademark ... though it took me a few years to warm up to the idea of the turtlenecks. One indication of in what high esteem COSMOS was held in our household is that -- cover your eyes, libertarians -- it was one of the few television shows airing after 7pm that we were "allowed" to watch in our household. My father was a professor of environmental sciences (my mom collaborated as a library archivist at the college which employed him) and was himself smitten not only by Sagan''s emphatic encouragement of scientific method, natural sciences, and critical thinking based on empirical observation, but was also an avid classical music fan. No doubt he believed (quite rightly) that Sagan''s populist method of teaching science crossed with his frequent use of Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi might encourage me to toss my Queen and Sex Pistols records into the trash and perhaps choose a life devoted to science.It didn''t quite work out that way, though I did initially choose anthropology as a major when entering college half a decade later, and am sympathetic to the music of Mozart and Vivaldi in particular (the hallowed Vangelis album which contained the show''s iconic theme music also found it''s way into my library of records, right next to The Clash, Dead Kennedys, and Monty Python) but eventually chucked it all aside after a month of Biology 101, and transferred into Visual & Performing Arts, with an emphasis on Media Studies, video production, and experimental studios. Eventually clips from COSMOS found their way into some of my experimental video works, and one of Sagan''s brilliant lines opened up the Master''s Thesis in Studio Arts that I composed in 1997: "The universe is not required to be in perfect harmony with human ambition." I am not sure who coined the phrase, but the most correct thing that can be said about Sagan''s prose is that he was incapable of writing an uninteresting sentence. COSMOS is brimming with one interesting sentence after the other, and perhaps his greatest contribution to the human condition in regards to this show was to demonstrate that science was not necessarily an exercise in applied boredom. Science could be an exciting "personal journey" of discovery, and his enthusiasm for endowing his viewers with a zeal for critical thinking helped me to breeze my way through high school biology & chemistry, which made perfect sense by the time I encountered the ideas presented.COSMOS also encouraged the young people who witnessed it at the time that science could actually be COOL, and that it was cool to be smart, informed, inquisitive, and open to new ideas. It was also pretty far out television, and during the second year it was on the air as repeats I made a point to always watch the show while stoned on whatever marijuana that I could get my chubby little hands on. We used to joke about Carl Sagan "smoking billions and billions of Quaaludes", so imagine my surprise when it came out after his far to early death at the age of 62 that he was a lifelong cannabis user himself. Just like with chemistry, it makes perfect sense once you think about it, though these days it''s almost impossible to watch some of the episodes without relating certain on screen mannerisms as being chocked up to Sagan having probably been completely baked during filming.One of my favorite moments from the show perhaps speaks most clearly for what endeared him to me: It''s during a sequence when he discusses the social hysteria that gripped the earth in 1911 when it became clear that the Earth would pass through the trail of Halley''s Comet, composed in part of cyanogen gas.

Carl Sagan, an astronomer and one of the greatest popularizers of science of all time, addresses in this 13 episode series some of the more profound questions that humans sometimes find themselves asking. "How did we get here?" "What lies out in space beyond the Earth?" Sagan does it all through a scientific point of view, while still keeping it personal and easy to understand for the audience.Don''t think that just because Cosmos is from 1980 that it is outdated. It is a very well done series, and the themes that it addresses are just as relevant to today''s world as it was when this program first came out. While it mostly focuses on scientific topics such as space exploration, evolution, and the human brain, it also brings up topics like nuclear disarmament and the danger of believing in superstition. While Sagan makes sure that every statement he says is supported by evidence, he is not afraid to say that, at least at the time, there are some things in the universe that science simply does not know.Using plenty of visuals and layman''s terms, Sagan does a good job to make sure the viewer doesn''t feel alienated from the complex issues that this series tackles. Cosmos is not some cold educational program. It is also very emotional, showing us how small we are in the universe and how fragile our planet actually is. Watching this series has allowed me to understand some basic things about the universe that I never even considered—"In order to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe." I wholeheartedly recommend this program to any human capable of thinking.

It seemed like it would just turn out to be another cheesy, serialized anime whose only purpose is to make cash. That, and when I watched the first Avatar episode, I noticed that it wasn''t a ''true'' anime. Avatar is, what I call, ''hybrid'' anime: in other words, anime created here in North America. This only added to my skepticism. I have had bad experiences with hybrid anime. Shows like Martin Mystery and Totally Spies are hybrids, and watching them nearly makes me gag. The anime style is chosen for no reason other than to attract audiences. Their movements are quick, jerky, and you can tell they try way to hard to mimic traditional anime style, but in that sense, they fail horribly. Their written is witless and linear (i.e: the jokes in Totally Spies all relate to some sort of stereotype of girls, like hair, nails, etc) and the plot lines are all contrived (i.e: every episode of Martin Mystery). Yet Avatar: The Last Airbender succeeded where all other ''hybrids'' had failed. The anime style was chosen for artistic reasons, and each of the character''s movements are very fluid, and almost reach movie quality. There are typical anime elements that give the show a surreal touch without taking it over the edge, such as Appa, the flying bison, or the Spirit World. The action scenes probably impressed me the most, as the animators focus mainly on the ensuing battle, and not so much as the reactions of the fighter''s or the onlookers. Each battle has a point, as well, and not just some random duel. The character''s are very well drawn out, not just in an animated-sense, but also the depth of each character. But more importantly, we see these characters evolve through their adversities, and we see how they struggle to cope with their tasks, which sometimes require them to question their morals. Again, the humour in Avatar is genuine, and always makes me laugh, whether it be a quick quip from Sako, the running joke of the Cabbage Man, or even the coincidential irony. Even it''s serious moments are well written, and the character''s words have a deeper meaning. One of my favourite quotes is, "Part of being a man is knowing where you are needed". But what impressed me the most is how deep Avatar actually goes. The show has it''s own mythology that is easy to follow, but sports a deeper meaning. Each tribe or nation represents a different element, but the fire nation is the main antagonist in Avatar. Yet we gain insight as to why this is. Fire is probably the most dangerous element, as it is essentially alive, and can destroy almost anything. This give us insight into the fire nation''s need for power. Yet the fire nation has its own morals too, and we occasionally see things from their side, a technique that helps us gain better understanding for the fire nation, and even creates pathos for character''s like Prince Zuko. Each tribe has it''s own special abilities, relating to their element, and this relationship between man and nature is a common motif that permeates through many anime movies and shows (Hayao Miyazaki''s "Princess Mononoke" and "Nausicaa" are excellent examples of this). Various symbols of Chinese mythology also show up in the series (i.e: panda bear''s, dragons, etc.) giving the show another level of depth. Avatar is, at its core, a story of growing up and facing fate, no matter how hard it is. I am so glad I was introduced to Avatar, and I am pleasantly surprised by its depth and wit. The voice acting fits the character''s perfectly, and even the music is a joy to listen to. I would gladly recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender to practically anyone.', '6 August 2006');

I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let''s start with the story overall. Avatar tells a complete a perfectly paced epic plot over the course of 61 22 minute episodes. The show contains several unique and beautifully detailed characters among its main cast, all of whom are given consistent and engaging development throughout. From family related guilt and angst, identity dilemmas and the characters constant, overarching and looming quest, the characters are pressed with many trials which actually truly change them over the course of their magnificent journey. Aside from the primary cast, many intriguing and varied side characters appear throughout the adventure. They offer comedic levity, new forms of drama and help to add to the deep mythological and philosophical backbone of the show. All characters are exquisitely written and voice acted, with not a badly portrayed among them. Next I will cover the show''s borderline legendary animation. It is a sight to behold indeed. I believe I am justified in believing that such stellar production values will never again be pared with this level of artistic imagination again, at least not in my lifetime. The scope, creativity and energy of the shows animation is second to no other show, and it''s balance of colour is never anything less than sublime. Aside from sweeping and moving visuals, Avatar also offers fast paced and unbelievably well choreographed action scenes (once again, second to none) and well timed slapstick comedy. Not only is the animation stunning, it is also staggeringly versatile. The show''s epic mythos is also very strong, and demands to be deepened and added to (thankfully Korra is doing just that). It takes inspiration from Buddhist, Inuit, Western, Japanese and Korean cultures to deliver it''s unique world, as well as many original and creative elements in conjunction with the more recognisable real world concepts. The show manages to weave philosophy and deep moral concepts within its world and characters, creating one of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds of the last several decades. In conclusion, what can I even say? I love Avatar: TLA more every time I experience it, and it is one of very few shows (or even films) which can provoke a primal emotional response from me each time I see it, without fail. It sends shivers down my spine, and puts a tear to my eye, leaving me totally satisfied and fulfilled each time. My favourite television show, of all time.', '15 August 2014');

Have been watching the BBC less over time, but there are always exceptions, unexpected gems and expected treasures that come our way every now and again and their nature documentaries are the perfect examples of expected treasures. ''Life'' is a crowning achievement for a documentary series and actually, like the best documentary shows, feels much more than that. As far as Attenborough''s work goes too, ''Life'' to me is one of his biggest achievements.''Life'' is an exceptionally well-made series first and foremost, in fact saying that doesn''t do the production values justice. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The editing is always succinct and smooth and the scenery and various habitats are remarkably diverse and look speechlessly spectacular.On a documentary level, ''Life'' continually fascinates and illuminates, while there are some familiar facts here a lot of it was very much new (like a lot of the principles of evolution) and by the end of the series for me more was gotten out of it, and educated me much more than, anything taught when studying Geography in secondary school. Attenborough''s narration helps quite significantly too, he clearly knows his stuff and knows what to say and how to say it. He delivers it with his usual richness, soft-spoken enthusiasm and sincerity, never talking down to the viewer and keeping them riveted and wanting to know more.The wildlife and life-forms are both adorable and dangerous, the wide-ranging diversity of what was included was staggering and it was lovely to see a mix of the familiar and the not-so-familiar. How they adapt to their environments, why they behave the way they do, how nature works and how what the wildlife and life-forms do affects their environments were all touched upon and made their points subtly, not hammering it home too much (a potential danger with documentaries).Many powerful and poignant moments, as well as suspenseful ones, while not trying too hard to evoke a viewer reaction. One really cares for what they''re told and the wildlife. Each episode doesn''t feel like an episodic stringing of scenes, but instead like the best nature documentaries each feels like their own story and journey, with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.Overall, a crowning achievement, for Attenborough and nature documentaries in general. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '14 October 2017');

David Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a national treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the term.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. ''Planet Earth II'' is as good as others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecessor one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actually feels much more than that. Throughout it''s an awe-inspiring, utterly transfixing experience where one forgets they''re watching a documentary and instead feeling like they''re watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but to me and many others ''Planet Earth II'' is completely deserving of its praise and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BBC has done in years.''Planet Earth II'' for starters looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and real life, the mountains in "Mountains" in particular are spectacular and "Jungles" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle beautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normally bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter moments, Hans Zimmer''s music here is a remarkably good fit, it''s unmistakably Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances them.What of the narrative aspects? Can''t fault ''Planet Earth II'' in this aspect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise. In short, it''s just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance was even achieved in the "Cities" episode, that may have been the one that transfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habitats of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illuminate, and credit has to go to ''Planet Earth II'' for adhering to what made ''Planet Earth'' work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nice ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, there''s a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never preaches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins in "Islands") and the dangerous (the lions in "Grasslands" and "Deserts"), and one actually finds they''re rooting for them in exactly the same way they would a human character. ''Planet Earth II'' contains a good deal of suspense (especially in "Deserts") and emotional impact ("Islands"). Even the fights/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in "Jungles".It doesn''t feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes feel episodic or repetitive. ''Planet Earth II'' instead feels like a collection of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans of ''Planet Earth'', ''Planet Earth II'' is not to be missed at all costs and has more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding something new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '13 October 2017');

Luckily, ''Blue Planet II'' turned out to be every bit as amazing, easily a highlight of 2017 television (a strong contender for the best BBC produced one and the best nature documentary series) and one of not many 2017 dramas/series that had me looking forward to see the entire lot. This is saying a lot, seeing as apart from the odd gem 2017 has not seen me watching new television by habit, often find myself seeing re-runs or films.OK, so ''Blue Planet II'' may not be as ground-breaking as ''The Blue Planet'' and not everything is new here. This doesn''t matter, because ''Blue Planet II'' is just as beautiful to watch, non-stop transfixing, educational, inspirational and emotionally complex.Visually, ''Blue Planet II'' was, as it was with ''The Blue Planet'' and the best of Attenborough''s work, a wonder. It has gorgeous scenery and rich colours, while the animals and marine life are captured in all their glory. Standing out even more is the photography, the underwater sequences are just as stunning as ''The Blue Planet'' (unequalled when it comes to underwater sequences).While not with the involvement of George Fenton, the music here soars, rouses just as much and touches the soul just as much, definitely worthy of cinematic quality. It not only complements the visuals but enhances them to a greater level.Really can''t fault the narrative aspects in ''Blue Planet II'' either. There are things already known to me, still delivered with a lot of freshness, but there was a lot that was quite an education and after watching the full series it honestly felt like the series taught me a lot about the mysteries of the ocean and the marine life that inhabit it. One episode explores the consequences of environmental waste and, while it may seem out of place for some, it was very much relevant and important and well-handled.Attenborough''s narration helps quite significantly too, he clearly knows his stuff and knows what to say and how to say it. He delivers it with his usual richness, soft-spoken enthusiasm and sincerity, never talking down to the viewer and keeping them riveted and wanting to know more.''Blue Planet II'' has a lot of effective scenes. It''s not easy picking a standout, because there is a lot of emotional complexity here. There are shockingly gut-wrenching moments, especially the whale carcass (a strong contender for the most shocking scene of 2017). There are emotional moments, such as the mother with the dead calf. There are tense moments like the octopus and the shark. There are awe-inspiring moments like with the dolphins. There are also moments of great surprise, like in the first episode where one expects a bird to fall prey to an underwater predator but instead something that one cannot believe was able to be filmed let alone found happens.Nothing episodic or repetitive here. Instead, it feels like its own individual story with real, complex emotions and conflicts. One roots for the animals, whether prey or predator. The behind the scenes footage "The Deep Blue" brings honesty and humanity, what the crew go through and how they work against sometimes volatile conditions makes the viewer feel admiration for them.In short, utterly amazing and calling ''Blue Planet II'' a must watch does it no justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox', '6 December 2017');

But there are a fair share of films and television that don''t do much or anything for me and those that start/started off very promisingly, in some cases brillantly, but decline badly, a major example being ''House of Cards''.Am however a massive fan of the national treasure that is David Attenborough, as is my sister, and when hearing that he had done a new series and it was on Netflix we just couldn''t say no to watching it. The best of Attenborough''s work, old and new, are genre landmarks and are incredible in their own right, his career has spanned decades and has been remarkably consistent. In that there is not a dud in the whole of his extensive filmography, his more flawed work still being decent, which is a rarity and something that has been deliberately reiterated by me many times. The 8 part ''Our Planet'' was one of our most highly anticipated programmes, watching it we were utterly transfixed by the images, fascinated by all the animals and felt a wide gaumt of emotions. Whether biting our nails, shedding multiple tears, going awww at anything cute and even laughing. After watching ''Our Planet'' we were shocked, inspired, very moved and in awe, not many programmes so far this year have made me feel like this. So far this year, this has been among the very best and very special, and in a completely different league when it comes to Netflix shows. Even if it isn''t one of Attenborough''s best or most ground-breaking.''Our Planet'' is not about animals in beautiful environments being painted in a cute, reassuring and one-sided light, that was something that the brilliant ''Dynasties'' was criticised for before it was even aired. Don''t think either that it would offer nothing new. Some have criticised it for having an agenda and executing it heavy-handedly. The portrayal of the animals is far from reassuring, some are cute and some are quirky but much of the time the portrayal is complex and uncompromising, all without over-humanising them even in very human conflicts. The environments/habitats do look absolutely glorious ("Jungles" being a prime example), make no mistake about that, but there is much more to them than that with them also being unforgiving and even fragile. "Frozen Worlds" especially.Regarding whether it offers anything new or not, the environments (jungles, the Arctic, deserts, grasslands etc.) and animals like penguins and killer whales are familiar. But there are also some rare animals not seen before (like in "Jungles" with the preening bird), familiar species doing uniquely different things like the caterpillars in "From Deserts to Grasslands" or the ants in "Jungles". It may seem on the outset that it''s familiar, to me there was a different approach to the material, helped by the wide range of camera techniques where you see many animals up close in a way never seen before like with the Arabian Leopard and the cheetah it is very intimate.Did not find its heavy emphasis on conservation too preachy, unlike some. A lot of ''Our Planet'' shows both the wonders of the planet, with all the different species and their behaviours (both familiar and unique) and the different habitats and the fragility of them as their environment is threatened and what human destruction does. What was said was important and things long needing to be addressed, with harrowing sequences like the endings of "Our Planet" and "Frozen Worlds", and with the predatory fungi, making one really sit up and think as well as feeling emotional and shell-shocked. Did find that the heavy emphasis on it was not a bad thing, considering that it applies to all the environments covered and many of the animals and such, such as the megafauna. It''s not all doom and gloom, parts are hopeful.''Our Planet'' does in all eight episodes look amazing. The scenery takes the breath away, especially in "Jungles" and "Coastal Seas", but it is more than just beautiful scenery. For example in "Our Planet" and "Frozen Worlds" one is reminded of how cruel that environment is. The scenery is complemented by photography of quite cinematic quality with a wider range of camera techniques rarely seen before, not just a feast for the eyes but it is also expansive and intimate in equal measure, enhancing the i', '2 May 2019');

Now that the show finished last night all I can think to say is Wow! This has truly been one of the best things I have ever seen produced for any format of entertainment, except novel since historian Stephen Ambrose fills in a lot more information that the series just couldn''t handle. Every actor from Damian Lewis to the man who played Private Hall in the first episode performed admirably. Of special interest is Lewis who''s character really matures as the show progresses, Ron Livingston who in episode nine loses some of the cockiness that his character Nixon exhibits throughout the show, Matthew Settle who plays the intimidating Capt. Ronald Speirs just seems to ooze the violent edge the character needs, and Donnie Wahlberg who unlike his brother seems to play more interesting characters. Also of special interest is David Schwimmer as Capt. Herbert Sobel. Even though the character is pretty much a piss ant, there is that one moment after he loses command of the company that you sort of feel sorry for him. Another plus is the production crew who really turned England into four different countries. No one place from  Carentan to Bastgone looks like the same country. Another plus is the special effects, which really shine in episode two and four. The night jump on Normandy with the flak exploding around planes and one plane bursting into flames looks as good as anything done for a major film. Also whoever thought of including snippets of interviews with real easy veterans definitely help set the tone for the episodes. A good choice in my opinion.

I didn''t watch much movies, but just some random movies aired on HBO (not a whole movie of course, but segments of one). I had no idea how to start and a friend of mine suggested to watch according to IMDb list, and I did so. I then watched highest rated movies post 1990 (I didn''t like cinematography of movies before 1990). I spent about 6 months watching movies, and next 6 months re-watching them. I wasn''t that dedicated in anything till then. I then had rough ideas what a good movie is like. Next three months I watched movies irrespective of their rating. Then I started watching pre-1990 movies. I used to see long reviews from movie critics, and users (from IMDb and Quora), just to check if my view in a particular movie tallies with their or not. I thus spent a year and half watching and re-watching movies. I think I watched few movies more than 15 times. ''The more re-watchable is the movie is, the best it is'', this is my view on movies now, after a year of continuous watching. There isn''t a single good movie I have watched just once. After I was satisfied with that, I started watching series.Then I wasted next 1.5 year watching series. My grades were falling miserably, because I was literally addicted in it. I watched a lot of series (according to IMDb ranking, and popularity of course), and maybe I was biased, Breaking Bad was my favourite one. It was just slightly better than The Sopranos according to my view. have watched every episodes of Breaking Bad and The Sopranos 3 times, the second time to understand missed details and the third time to search for mistake and fact-checking. For fact checking of The Sopranos I watched podcast (or interview, whatever) with Michael Franzese, and found out it was not that factually correct, so BrBa just slightly surpassed The Sopranos. I knowingly ignored some goofy science of BrBa (like blue meth being the purest, mercury fulminate being so crystal clear and being explosive only after throwing, and so on) thinking that they were there just the tools to spice up the plot, which was acceptable to me. I watched GoT, but it wasn''t my taste (only thing I love in fantasy genre is ''Lord of the Rings''. Besides the final season took it far from league. ''The Office US'', ''It''s Always Sunny in Philadelphia'', ''Curb your Enthusiasm'' and ''Seinfeld'' are my personal favourites in sitcoms. I don''t mix sitcoms with series because I believe they are two separate things. I love ''True Detective S01'', even more than BrBa, but I classified it under mini-series (I couldn''t watch True Detective S02 after True Detective S02E01, and same goes for S03). So, by comparison Breaking Bad was my favourite series until I watched ''The Wire''.I started watching ''The Wire'' in this COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. At first I found it quite difficult to catch up with it''s content because I had trouble remembering character''s name (because there are too many), and it''s vast plot. Nonetheless, I never lost my interest watching it. Most people say it''s boring, but I didn''t feel that way. It''s different from other series because other series wrap everything interesting in each episodes, but The Wire wraps things up in each season. I believe the flawless flow of episode was interesting enough to keep me moving on. The acting of each actors and actresses is good. I won''t say acting is the best, but it is good enough for their character. The realness and authenticity of the series is it''s signature.

A thirteen part documentary series, it won both an Emmy and a Peabody Award at the time of its original broadcast and has subsequently become the most watched PBS program in the world (and held the U.S record for a decade until Ken Burns'' The Civil War aired). Not bad for what on the surface would seem to be a long documentary on space. Cosmos though is far more then just that though. Cosmos is an epic journey with few boundaries and many lessons. Thanks to its host Carl Sagan and its three writers (Sagan, Ann Druyan and Steven Soter) Cosmos covers a wide range of topics. These range from the origins of life, its evolution from single cell to modern humans, the ongoing battles between science and superstition, our own evolving outlook on the universe, our fascination with the planet Mars (the subject of the fifth episode "Blues for a Red Planet"), the complexity of the human brain (episode 11 "The Persistence of Memory"), the possible existence of extraterritorial life and our species own survival in the future to name a few of the topics covered in the series. As a result, Cosmos touches on a huge variety of topics that covers much of the human condition and the universe around us at the same time. While some of the science is inevitably out of date after three decades, this is made up for by the afterwords at the end of most episodes and the series has actually predicted a number of things as well (such as the early version of the rovers now exploring Mars seen in the fifth episode). Despite some of the science being out of date, Cosmos is still remarkable for the sheer number of topics in covers on its journey.It makes that journey thanks to fine production values. The series takes Sagan around the world to countries such as India, Egypt, Italy, Japan, France and Mexico along with places across the United States as well such as Sagan''s old elementary school where he speaks to children and the Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico). These foreign locations can also be seen in numerous historical segments that explore the history of astronomy or various events and people throughout history as well such as Johannes Kepler or Jean-François Champollion who became the first person in modern times to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. To take us beyond the Earth and out into the universe, the series gives us a "Spaceship of the Imagination" based on a a dandelion seed that becomes a reoccurring motif throughout the series. While its interior is exactly what you''d expect out of a 1970s science fiction spaceship, the places it takes the viewer to are not. The effects of the series (at least those not augmented and/or replaced by CGI versions) stand up rather well today such as Sagan walking through a recreation of the library of Alexandria, the beautiful "galaxy rise" seen at the end of episode nine "The Lives Of Stars" or the simple effects used to create the supernova seen in that same episode. Last but not least, perhaps, is the use of music throughout the series from a wide range of sources both classical and more modern including the opening music or the use of Holst''s "Mars The Bringer Of War" to help create perhaps the definitive screen version of the famous opening paragraph from H.G. Wells The War Of The Worlds to name but two examples. The result is that Cosmos continues to stand up well even against more modern documentaries and is made even more effective as a result.The series greatest strength may well be in its host, Carl Sagan. Cosmos opening sequence subtitles it "A Personal Voyage" and Sagan, one of the most famous scientists of the late twentieth century, makes Cosmos just that. Sagan''s sense of wonder and excitement is evident throughout and it is those attributes that makes the potentially dull parts of this series (dull as in topic you might not personally be interested in) worth seeing. That is in large part because of Sagan''s ability to bring abstract concepts (such as the mathematical parts of Episode 10 "The Edge of Forever" or the Drake equation in Episode 12 "Encyclopaedia Galactica") down to a level that almost anyone should be able to understand and find exciting.

Then the whole story just went to a place that I could not imagine (which was good), and after awhile, I just realized that this series was so much better than the original series.

It''s all there. The archetypes of Zeus, long-suffering Hera, oracles, sibyls, the virginal Persephone, Zeus'' seduction of mere mortal women (who can be destroyed by it), the messengers and functionaries of Zeus, the wandering eye of the Most High himself, on and on it goes. AND there are the deep emotions and passions that go with it.Greek and Roman mythology has become so quaint to us we "teach" it to sixth graders and sent them to see Disney productions of Hercules as an example. (Disney doesn''t tell you the one about when Hercules batters one of his wives kills her and slaughters his children--I think that''s the way it goes.) The schools don''t "teach" about the mother who chops up her own children (whom she loves) to bake in a pie to feed to the husband she hates.They don''t "teach" the crazed women who mutilate the man who scorns them. Or the girl who arranges to sleep with her own father. What passes as the Greek myths in schools is really just kind of bullshit. Or...isn''t there one where Zeus makes love to a mortal woman who wants to see him in his "true form"? She burns up or something. Tony does that too, to the car saleswoman. What about the dancer at Bada Bing? I haven''t got to the end of the art gallery girl yet.But The Sopranos really approaches the bloodthirst of the Gods, their cruelty, their indifference to mere mortals...and their so, so human traits mixed in with their almost unbearable inhumanity. But don''t forget they sometimes show great wisdom and kindness too. The Gods and the Sopranos mingle with us mere mortals, but we say a little prayer of thanks when they pass us by. They know things we don''t.Personally speaking, when I think about "the mob," they seem to have the sort of reality to me (or your average Joe) of being sort of "out there", just like a forces of nature, and I don''t ever want to get them mad at me. I know I just might brush past them every once in a while, I''m sure, but I would hardly know it. If a mobster came to me in disguise, just as the Greek Gods were used to doing with mere mortals, I hope I would treat him in a way so as not to invoke his wrath in consequence. As a child, I felt about the Greek Gods with the same sense of mystery and heightened imagination, believing they were "out there" and about somewhere, but one just never really got to see them up-close.Now, I''m pretty sure this analogy to the Gods in The Sopranos is not done purposefully by the David Chase...he might have an awareness, sure, he''s incredibly smart, but he''s NOT making allusions to specifics...it''s not an algorithm. Or (gods help us) an homage. He''s just being true to the subject material in the best way he knows how--and it''s absolute dynamite. It''s no surprise the Sopranos reaches directly back to the Greeks. This kind of gradiosity and passion BELONG to the Sicilian and Italian culture (Sicily was an outpost of Ancient Greece) and have done for thousands of years. For Chase NOT to "go there" with the violence and sexuality would not be possible. The greatness of the Greco-ROMAN myths lies precisely in their depth of presenting vividly, exhaustively, splendidly, the all-too human capacity for evil (among other things). The myths are the extremes we are all capable of if pushed into passion. David Chase''s genius is that he has crystalized our cultural fascination of gangsters into a mythology worthy of the Greeks. I think his take on the mob is BETTER than Puzo or Scorsese. He somehow (consciously or unconsciously, I don''t know) recognized the archetypes involved, intimately, and ran with them.For anyone who thinks The Sopranos glorifies violence (as one dude posting here felt), that person needs to take a survey of literature or something. God, read Shakespeare. Take a course in history. Hell, look to Iraq. We live in a violent world. Learn how to digest story and context. Constantly, the show presents the REALITY but then, always the consequences.The pleasure of watching this show is that the barrier of the TV screen protects us. I think the writers are constantly reminding us of the moral dimension involved. The Sopranos is at the bottom of it, deeply moral. It''s about actions, and codes.

Talking about the French and American efforts early in the build up to the war was also great.The musical score, be it the opening by Bob Dylan, or the instrumental work done by Yo Yo Ma and Atticus Ross And Trent Reznor is as usual spot on and not overpowering or taking away from the story its backgrounding.All in all a great start which I look forward to seeing more of.', '18 September 2017');

From distant galaxies, nearby stars and the planets around us to the history of life on our planet from its ancient beginnings to modern humanity. There is also speculation; is there more life out there on other planets and if so what is it like? Will we ever find proof of such life or will we somehow destroy ourselves? There is also the history of science and scientists from ancient Greece to the renaissance to modern times.The success of this series is largely down to Carl Sagan; his presentation shows his passion for the subject and this passion is passed on to the viewer. I first watched the series as a child and found it awe inspiring; especially the then recent revelations about our solar system revealed by various probes; most notably the two Voyager missions. Watching again thirty five years later the series feels almost as fresh as it did then; some of the science has obviously progressed but this doesn''t feel dated and the DVD does include some ''science updates''. The special effects might show their age slightly at times but that doesn''t distract from the information Sagan is trying to impart.', '6 May 2015');

It''s more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value.
Where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It''s incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It''s everything that is bad in mainstream media.All of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is).

Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? With hesitation and doubt in my heart I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won''t lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn''t live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn''t do any of the above because I''m exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse''s voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic "in those days, we really believed..." lines from Al. With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn''t good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don''t compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don''t give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn''t miss out.', '23 June 2012');

Although some parts may be slow & boring, but if you watch the ending, it''ll feel like talking a deep dive in ganga river, where all your past sins are washed up ;)Thank you Vince Gilligan for bringing up this show. Breaking Bad, Dark and Mahabharata are those shows that made my lockdown somewhat interesting. Alright, alright let''s get back to the review :pSo, basically Breaking Bad is a crime drama or a crime thriller show, which revolves around Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who is a high school chemistry teacher, suffering from cancer. In order to make money & secure the future for his family, he joins the meth business, along with a high school drug addict junkie Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). And hence, their rollercoaster ride starts. It''s journey of many ups and downs. The most amazing part is the show''s accuracy towards science. I mean, they have to literally cut off some portions, so that the whole methamphetamine making process couldn''t be exposed :p It''s a treat for science students. 10/10 for that...You know what''s the best parts of the show:- It''s the ACTING and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I mean, you literally get physically, mentally and emotionally connected with each and every character of the show, no matter whether he''s the protagonist or the antagonist. In fact, there''s none of them in this show. In the start, we follow Walter and get connected to him, but until the end, Jesse steals our heart. Both Bryan and Aaron have nailed their characters. They''ve diggen deep into their characters.But wait, there are others too. Be it Skyler, Hank, Walter Jr, Guss, Saul, Mike, Badger, Skinny pete or Todd. All of them steals our heart. And, the ending duh, can it get any better ;)Overall, it''s a masterpiece. I wouldn''t call it the greatest TV show ever, coz i haven''t watched many other shows yet.

There are occasional episodes in seasons 3 and 4 that match the quality of the first two, some may even be better, but they''re outliers in their respective seasons. I''m afraid that the consistent quality of seasons 1&2 is gone for good.I could write pages and pages about why those first two seasons are so great, but I see no point in repeating what has already been written and said countless times. It''s a meme at this point that this is a smart show, but that doesn''t change the fact that it is. No, you don''t need extensive understanding of science and philosophy to watch it, and frankly, most people are probably here for the burp jokes. However, the depth truly is there whether you have the knowledge or desire to point to it or not.I''ve seen many people online trying to sound smug by saying that it isn''t a particulary clever show and that people pretending that it is are some neckbeard snobs who idolize the titled grandpa. In my time scouring through the various online discussions about the show, I haven''t actually come across a single one of these supposed Rick-idolizers, but I have come across hundreds of people mocking this "toxic part of the viewer base". This makes it all the sadder when I see the show actively trying to distance itself from these viewers by shoving into our faces what was told clearly, but subtly in previous seasons - that Rick is a deeply troubled soul no-one should look up to. So now, Rick that was previously shown to be a God power-wise can''t even win a fistfight with a season 4 one-time opponent. Seasons 1&2 portrayed Rick as someone who has problems precisely because of his power and the God complex it nurtures, but no, in order to show the toxic viewer that they shouldn''t admire him, they have de-powered him without any explanation.I also noticed that the writers are seemingly trying to buy time with season 4, as they''ve teased a big overarching plot with "evil Morty" and done some great worldbuilding with Citadel of Ricks in previous seasons, that they only mentioned in a season 4 meta episode so as to comment on the big expectations and apparent pressure they are under to come up with something that will be satisfying for the audience. It''s a filler episode, really and I''d rather they take a break and come up with something great then turn into another Simpsons now that they''re comfortably employed for the forseeable future.Previous two paragraphs are my interpretations of the symptomatology of the decline of this show. In the end, I believe the writers resorted to the described paths because they''ve run out of genuine inspiration and are simply trying to fill in the gaps between those episodes that are still "on the level" with anything they can come up with just to satisfy the demand. It''s a shame, really, and I hope all the filler will be worth it, but I''m sceptical as most shows never recover from a dip in quality.', '18 November 2020');

I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to them all. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt.Winters).

It was clearly tough for him, particularly when he had to order attacks on heavily defended objectives, without being to lead his former command directly.   All of the characters were developed enough that you cared about each of them as individuals, and felt the loss of each of them through the attrition during the brutal fighting in the Northern European Theater. They cared for each other as fighting men do (confirmed by my own experience in the infantry in Vietnam), but at the same time they had to carry on with the mission regardless of loss.  Replacements are regarded warily at first, but then managed to blend in with the veterans if they showed they were worthy of joining this band of brothers.  The plot is real, and as such is neither macho nor macabre--it just is presented as it really happened.  The truths of combat are stranger than fiction.

Full of lush imagery and wonderful animation, Cosmos is a pleasure to watch, and makes learning extremely easy, something that is becoming extremely difficult in the age of no attention span. Not only does Tyson allow for lighthearted, absorbable fact, but he also allows us to probe into our own imagination, and explore the universe ourselves. Everything in Cosmos is simplified for easy learning, yet isn''t dumbed down so far that the fact is closer to fiction – the visuals alongside Tyson''s wonderful commentary are absolutely mind-blowingly beautiful, but allow for visual learners to take something away from Cosmos as well.Tyson finished the episode with a heartfelt story involving his relationship with Carl Sagan, and his inspirational ways – I hope that many are inspired by Tyson''s breath of fresh air in the documentary genre, and allows for the population of the world to reach for the stars. Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is absolutely worth a watch, it is entertaining, heartfelt, absorbable, and most important, educational.

After 5-6 episodes I can''t get enough of it. After 2 seasons it was so real I felt like I was living in it. I''ve never seen a TV series like this and I doubt I ever will. The Wire is more like a literature than a drama. It cover every angle in such great detail that in the end I felt like I was standing in the corner, police station, dock watching them doing their things rather than watching a staged acting. Breaking Bad and True Detective are also two of my 10/10 favs but The Wire make them look like cartoons (Very good cartoons. Not in a bad way).', '30 October 2014');

But I soon realised that The Wire is more familiar than foreign to me; the emotions it portrays are so beautifully and often devastatingly evoked by the wonderful cast of mostly unknowns that I often find myself relating to and empathising with the police department''s moral dilemmas or the actions of the Baltimore drug dealers.What makes The Wire so special is its unpredictability; unlike most ratings-conscious American TV shows it has no qualms about killing off its protagonists midway through a season, notably Stringer Bell''s demise at the end of season three. It never panders to the viewer''s shallow desires but instead goes ahead and above all of their expectations, which of course makes for a better show. Conversely, it always allows its viewers to judge moral situations for themselves and is never preachy, thus explaining why my favourite characters on the show, Stringer Bell, Bodie, and Bubbles rack up multiple murders, drug heists and other dubious acts between them. You often find yourself sympathising with, for example, the mass-murderer Wee-Bey over Police Chief Burrell in season one, which exemplifies the shows'' genius.That this show never won a single Emmy or other award is tantamount to a crime in my opinion, when you consider that cookie-cutter, one-murder-solved-per-episode crime shows like CSI rake them in every year. As clichéd as it sounds, other programmes just don''t take you on the emotional journey that the Wire does. I can''t think of a single time where I have been moved to tears by another show in the same way that the fate of sweet, enterprising Randy in Season four or the necessary but horrific death of Stringer Bell in the preceding season moved me.I could write all day about this wonderful show, closer to a novel than a televised programme, but The Wire''s makers and producers- and more so the near-perfect cast- say more than I ever could in sixty hours of television. A perfect ten.', '21 June 2009');

When the first episode came out I watched it for about 10 mins. and I thought wow and couldn''t stop watching. The show I think keeps you involved. Nick has picked some bad shows but not this one. The plot is very well designed and characters are thought out and are dynamic. I think thats what makes a show good. Also the fact that when a show ends then next time then it carrys on what happened in the next episode rather than acting like it never happened. The show captures a sense of reality and makes the audience more into it. The writers write some pretty decent material. Classic comedy and new moral comedy with good values.

I was anxious to see the entire series again so I ordered the Blu-Ray version of the series and have greatly enjoyed seeing the series again in crisp and beautiful high resolution.It seems that the relatively small ratio of people who give this series very low ratings have one or more of just several objections: they don''t believe that the Earth is as old as it is, for religious reasons; they object to the scientific material and assessment of the carbon dioxide we''re adding to the atmosphere and its implications for the global warming we''re experiencing, for ideological (almost religious) reasons; and an objection to the "theory" of evolution, for religious reasons.I have a couple questions for the religious people who believe that the Earth is only 6-10 thousand years old-- How did Noah and his family collect and place on the ark the many tiny or microscopic animals on Earth at that time, all the insects, the tiny tardigrades, all the bacteria and other microscopic organisms? And since the flood covered the world and must have killed all the land plants from both submersion and the poisonous effects of the dissolved salts in ocean water, and since plants weren''t included in the species to be saved by the ark, why do we have the vast diversity of plants that exist today? Did they all evolve after Noah and the Flood? Cosmos is an extremely good series that accomplishes the astonishing feat of being appealing and fascinatingly educational to both adults and children. It is a great asset to us as a society. Thank you to everyone involved in its production.', '25 June 2014');

This at least shows realism, instead of SPR(Which was also VERY good-don''t get me wrong), but this just appeals more. It''s a great piece of work, with much dedication put into it, especially the real interviews with the veterans at the beginning/end of a part. You don''t just see American G.I''s just storming Germans and winning, they were actually facing Elite Waffen SS and Panzer divisions, also of the SS. They have fought in Normandy in the midst of the misdrops. Getting massacred at Carentan, Fighting in Nuenen, Freezing in Bastogne. And above all getting even move casualties even after the war is over.

It''s complex, fascinating and exhausting, all in one. No clean cut characters, no good-guys / bad-guys, no straight forward stories. Each season deals with a different subject: illegal drug dealing, international criminal organisations, social problems related to drugs, political corruption, the media. All of it pictured with such attention to details, in such a realistic and unbiased way, supported by such high-quality acting and writing, that you can be sure you won''t be disappointed at any time. The series is slow-cooking style, with little especial effects and a rather conventional editing. This might sound old-fashioned, but the approach to the themes and characters is so honest that the result is simply classical, timeless.

I ignored everyone''s comments for YEARS, whenever they hear that I never watched a single episode of avatar in my life. When I mentioned about Avatar 2 might come out (blue monkeys alien), he thought I meant airbender and I said no. He said he would re-watch the whole avatar episodes with me just to get me started. He said I missed the best classic animation. 
I gave it a shot. Oh my goodness, the story is very well made and jokes are hilarious! I can''t believe this is a kid''s show. If you have children go watch it with them now! If you don''t watch it with your friends and family. The story is very decent for kid''s show. I want to check out if there is a book or something.

The commentary from the actual soldiers that were in those situations is touching, to say the very least. These commentaries also help to move the character development along quite a bit, as it lets us into their own personal thoughts on the situations they faced. This project, to the best of my knowledge was undertaken at roughly the same time as Saving Private Ryan, using many of the same locations and also employing DreamWorks special effects, giving it a very familiar feel for anyone that has seen Private Ryan. As I''ve already touched on, the character development is greatly due to the fact that this story is not told in a two hour segment, but throughout several hour long intervals, giving us the chance to truly "get to know" the characters personalities as the story develops. In my humble opinion, the only other military type mini series'' that even come close to the scope of this one are The Blue and The Grey, and North and South.All of the actors in this series do and excellent job at playing the roles appropriately and making us believe the hell these men were put through. The thing I also appreciated about the cast is the lack of any "real" names, leading to us not knowing who may or may not be making it out the scenes alive and unscathed.This mini series is everything Saving Private Ryan was, as well as everything it wasn''t.
